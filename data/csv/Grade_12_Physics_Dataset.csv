"Magnetic flux is defined as the product of the average magnetic field times the perpendicular area it penetrates. In case of magnetic flux orientation of the area vector is considered.

Faraday’s Experiment 1. One of the scientists Faraday performed series of experiments and based on the results he gave law on induction. He introduced the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction. Induction means to induce or to generate something. Electromagnetic Induction means production of electric current due to magnetic field. Magnetic field is capable of producing current in a conductor. Faraday took a coil and attached a galvanometer to it. As there is no battery attached therefore there is no source of current. He brought the magnet near the coil. When the magnet is moved towards the coil galvanometer showed deflection. Galvanometer even showed the deflection in the opposite direction when the magnet is taken away from the coil. When magnet was not moved there was no deflection in the galvanometer. This show current is related to magnet. Faster the magnet is moved the more is the deflection in the galvanometer.This showed more and more current flows if the magnet is moved very fast. Same effect was observed if the coil is moved and the magnet was not moved. Observation:- Relative motion between magnet and coil induced electric current in the coil.,"Definition, Reasoning "
"Faraday’s Experiment 2. Faraday took a coil but instead of taking magnet he took another coil which was connected to the battery. When the coil attached with battery was brought nearanothercoil,the galvanometer showed the deflection. The same phenomenon repeated even when there was no magnet. This shows current flowing in one coil was able to induce current in another coil. Observation:- Relative motion between coils induces the electric current.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Faraday’s Experiment 3. In this experiment he wanted to prove whether the relative motion between the 2 coils is essential for the induction of current. In this case he took a coil, one more coil attached with a battery.
When the circuit was open there was no current flowing through the coil. But as soon as the circuit was switched on there was deflection in the galvanometer. When the circuit was on continuously for longer period of time there was no current. When the circuit is switched off there was a deflection in the galvanometer in the opposite direction. And if the circuit is switched off for long time there was no deflection in the galvanometer.
He observed that the galvanometer showed momentarily deflection only when the system was undergoing a change. Observation:- Relative motion is not an absolute requirement for inducing current. There was induced current only when there is change in the system. Based on these 3 experiments Faraday gave 3 laws of Induction.","Definition, Reasoning "
"Faraday’s laws of Induction. First law: -According to the first law an emf is induced in the circuit whenever the amount of magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes. Current was induced because of magnetic flux, as there is some current in the circuit therefore there will be some emf flowing in the circuit. Whenever the amount of magnetic flux linked with the circuit changes only at that time emf is induced. The induced emf will be there till there is change in the flux. When the magnet was moved then only there was change in the flux. As the magnet is moving the number of magnetic lines crossing the area is also changing. There is a change in the flux therefore there is induced emf. If the magnet is not moving, there will be no change in the amount of magnetic flux so there is no induced current.
 ",Definition
Second law: - According to the second law the magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit. Emf which is induced will depend upon rate at which the magnetic flux is changing. Mathematically:-  Let Φ1 = flux at initial time t=0. Φ2 = flux after time t. Rate of change of flux=(Φ2 – Φ1)/t =dΦ/dt. According to Faraday’s law:- Induced emf e ∝ (dΦ/dt) Experimentally the constant of proportionality was found to be 1 in all cases. Therefore e=(dΦ/dt). Consider a coil which has N number of turns;Therefore e = N(dΦ/dt),"Definition, Formula"
"Lenz’s law. According to Lenz’s law:-The polarity of the induced emf is such that it tends to produce induced current in such a direction that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. The (-) ive sign in given equatione= (-) (dΦ/dt)tells about the direction.According to Faraday’s law whenever there is change in the magnetic flux, emf is induced, as aresult there will be induced current. According to Lenz’s law the direction of the induced current will be such that it opposes the change in the magnetic flux. For example:- Consider a circuit where the magnetic flux is increasing, as a result flux will change and which induces the emf in the circuit, and as a result current will be induced in the circuit. The direction of the induced current will be such that it will oppose the cause which induced it. The induced current will be in such a direction that it decreases the magnetic flux. Note: - The induced current will try to oppose the change which is producing it. For example:- Consider a setup which has a coil, a magnet and a galvanometer. If the north pole of the magnet is brought near the coil, there will be a deflection in the galvanometer because of induced current. The direction of the induced current will be such that it opposes the motion of the magnet towards coil. Induced current will move the magnet away from the coil. As the north polarity of the magnet is brought near the coil as a result the induced current will be in such a direction that the face of the coil will have north polarity.The current will flow in the anti-clockwise direction. If the South Pole of the magnet was nearer to the coil then the current will flow in clockwise direction.","Definition, Examples"
Lenz’s law: supports Conservation of energy. Lenz’s law obeys conservation of energy. Magnet is moving as a result current is getting induced and when the magnet is not moving there is no induced current in the coil.There is a mechanical energy involved with the movement of the as magnet as a result mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy which is produced by the induced current. Magnetic energy used in moving magnet is getting transformed into electrical energy which is produced by the induced current. This shows that Lenz’s law supports conservation of energy where one form of energy is getting transformed into another form. Work done in moving the magnet is dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.,Property
Direction of Induced current: Lenz law. Induced current opposes CHANGE in flux. Example1: - Consider a region where magnetic field is acting in downward direction. Let magnetic field be 20T and it gets converted to 10T in the downward direction. As the magnetic field is changing therefore there is change in the flux which is equal to the decrease in the flux. As there is change in the flux there will be induced current. Flux of the induced current will try to oppose the decrease in the flux. Therefore the direction of induced flux will also be in the downward direction. Applying Fleming’s Right hand Thumb rule the direction of current will be given in the clockwise direction.,Property
"Example2:- Consider a magnetic field of 20T in the upward direction.If the magnetic flux is reduced to 10T in the downward direction. Both magnitude and the direction are changing. As flux is changing therefore there will be induced current. The direction of the induced flux will be in the opposite direction. i.e. upward direction. The induced flux will oppose the change which is the downward direction. The direction of the current will be in the anticlockwise direction. Example3:- Consider a region having downward magnetic field and there is a rectangular loop which is entering the region of magnetic field. As a result flux increases, the induced flux will oppose the increase in the flux.i.e. it will decrease the flux. Therefore induced flux will be in the upward direction. As a result the induced current will be in the anti-clockwise direction. Example4:- Consider a region having magnetic field in the downward direction and a rectangular loop which is coming out of the magnetic field with some velocity v. As it is coming out therefore flux is decreasing, current will be induced because of change in flux. Induced flux will try to oppose the change i.e. it will try to increase the flux. Induced flux is in the downward direction as a result the direction of current will be clock wise.","Examples, Reasoning "
"Direction of Induced current: Fleming’s right hand rule. According to Fleming’s right hand rule if we stretch 3 fingers of our right hand, then the :- Thumb will point to the motion of the conductor. First Finger points towards the magnetic field.

"Methods of producing Induced Emf in a circuit:Varying Magnetic Field (B). Consider a coil, a magnet and a galvanometer. As the magnet is brought near the coil,the magnetic field associated with the coil changes. Mathematically, Φ = BAcosθ if we change the strength of the magnetic field(B), the value of flux will change as a result emf is induced. When the magnet is brought near the coil, magnetic field changes. When the magnet passes through the coil the is a deflection in the galvanometer.","Reasoning, Formula"
"If the area within the magnetic field changes, then emf will be induced. The rectangular loop enters the magnetic field and goes out of the field. Initially there is no magnetic field from where the loop is starting, the moment the loop enters the magnetic field it experiences the change in the magnetic field at the boundary. When the loop was inside the magnetic field there was no change in the magnetic flux. But when the loop leaves the region of magnetic field there was decrease in the magnetic flux. Because when it leaves the magnetic field area keeps on decreasing. As area decreases therefore flux also decreases. At both the boundaries there is change in the area,as a result there is change in the flux. Therefore there will be induced current at the boundary.",Reasoning
"Mathematically:- The emf which is induced is known as Motional emf because this emf is induced due to the motion of the conductors. Consider a conductor is moving out of the magnetic field with some velocity ‘v’. The part which is inside the field =’X’ and length of the conductor=’length’. In time Δt, loop covers small distance Δx. Decrease in the area =-(length Δx), Where (-) ive sign shows decrease in area. Decrease in flux = dΦ =B.ΔA =-BlengthΔx where ΔA=change in area. Therefore from Faraday’s Lenz’s law, Induced emf e= -(dΦ/dt) =d/dt(BlengthΔx) => Blength (Δx/Δt) . Therefore Motional Emfe= Blengthv where (velocity) v= Δx/Δt
Induced current =I=(e/R) =(Blengthv/R) where R=resistance of the loop. Motional Emf comes into play when the area of the loop within the magnetic field changes.",Formula
"Methods of producing Induced Emf in a circuit: Varying Area (A) in a moving rod. Consider a rod which is moving inside the magnetic field. When the loop enters the magnetic field; due to the magnetic fieldthe charges inside the rod experiences the magnetic force. Because of this magnetic force the (+) ive and (-) ive charges separate out from each other, i.e. all the (+)ive charges get accumulated at one end and (-)ive charges on the other end. Electrostatic potential is developed on the rod due to the accumulation of charges on both the ends of the rod when it enters the magnetic field. Because of electrostatic potential an emf is induced. This emf which was induced on the rod cannot be used for any practical purposes. As it is an open circuit therefore induced emf on the rod cannot be used. This induced emf is known as Motional Emf as it is generated because of motion of the rod inside the magnetic field. Expression for motional emfe= Blengthv Example: Flight. At the tips of both the wings of the aeroplane emf is induced. As it is not a closed loop so this emf cannot be used.",Reasoning
Methods of producing Induced Emf in a circuit: Varying Area (A) in a closed loop(with movable piston). Consider a closed loop such that one arm of the loop acts as a movable piston. The loop is present inside a magnetic field. The movement of piston will cause a change in area of the loop. As there is change in area as aresult there is change in flux because of which there is induced emf.,Reasoning
"Methods of producing Induced Emf in a circuit: Varying angle between magnetic field and area vector (θ). By changing the orientation of coil and magnetic field i.e. θ emf can be induced in the circuit. Consider Φ = BA cosθ if θ is changed then the value of Φ will also change.For Example:- Electric generator-In case of electric generator there are rectangular coils and they are placed between the poles of the electromagnet.When it is rotated then the orientation of the area vector of the coil and magnetic field is changing. As θ is changing from 0 to 900,900 to 1800, 1800 to 2700 and 2700 to 3600. As a result there is change in flux and as a result emf is induced in the generator which in turn induces current in the generator.",Reasoning
Eddy currents. Eddy currents are induced currents in the body of conductor when subjected to changing magnetic flux.They are also known as Foucault current after the name of the scientist Foucault. They are known as eddy currents as they are in the pattern of eddiesin the water. Consider an electromagnet when attached to battery because of the current magnetic field will be produced which will induce current in the metallic plate. The current will be in the form of eddies. The metallic plate will be slightly drifted in the air because of eddy currents. Mathematically :- i=(induced emf)/(Resistance of the conductor) = (e/R) e= -(dΦ/dt) Therefore i=-(dΦ/dt)/R The magnitude and direction will be same as the induced current in the case of electromagnet induction.,"Definition, Formula"
"Examples of Eddy currents. Metal plate: In absence of magnetic field: No damping. Consider a metal plate which is suspended freely with the help of thread. As there is no magnetic field the plate will keep on oscillating without damping. Metal plate: In presence of magnetic field: Damping exists. If the magnetic field is present it oscillates but it stops after some time because of damping. As the plate keep on entering the magnetic plate and coming out of it. When it enters the region of magnetic field there is increase in area. As a result flux changes. As flux changes there is induced current.The direction of the induced current will be opposite to itsmean position. When the induced current leaves the magnetic field, again current will be induced but in the opposite direction. This effect of induced currents together gives the effect of eddy currents.
Because of induced current the motion is dampedas they are opposing the motion of the plate. Metal plate with slots: In presence of magnetic field: Damping reduced . When the plate oscillates the damping is reduced as there is lesser area. The eddy currents are less as a result damping is reduced. Eddy currents willoppose the motion of the plate and as they are reduced so there the damping is reduced. Conclusion: Eddy currents always have the tendency to oppose the relative motion. They are same eddies in the water because as the movement continues and currents also keep changing their direction depending on the change in flux. Therefore they look like eddies in the water. Eddy currents also cause damping as they oppose motion. Eddy currents are generated in the copper plate,while enteringand leaving the region ofmagnetic field. Cutting slots in the copper plate reducesthe effect of eddy currents.","Examples, Reasoning "
"Eddy currents:Disadvantages. Dissipate electrical energy in the form of heat. Overheating of metallic cores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices. In order to avoid the overheating of the core,metallic sheets are taken in the form of very thin sheets.These sheets are electrically insulated. The cores are insulated with some insulating material as a result heat won’t get transferred to surroundings. These cores are known as laminated cores. By using these cores eddy currents are reduced as a result heat dissipation is reduced.",Properties
"Eddy currents : Applications. Electromagnetic brakes –To control the speed of fast moving electric trains. In case of fast moving trains,on the tracks, magnets are placed so that currents are induced on the wheels of the train. Electromagnetic brakes do not need any maintenance. It is very economical alternative to friction brakes. Consider a very big magnet is placed near the track on which train will go. Outer rim of the wheel is coated with copper. When the wheel comes near the magnetic field it will experience the magnetic field produced by the magnet. This will result in change in flux and induced current will be produced. The direction will be given by Lenz’s law.The induced field will give rise to repulsiveinduced field at the boundary.As a result the train slows down a little. When the train moves to other end of the magnet it will experience an attractive force because of induced current in the opposite direction. Train gradually slows down and finally comes to rest. The kinetic energy lost by the train = the heat gained by the copper. It obeys the law of conservation of energy.

Electromagnetic damping:- Electromagnetic damping in galvanometers helps to reduce oscillations around equilibrium positions. Galvanometers are the instruments which help in measuring currents. When the current passes through the galvanometer there is a needle(needle is like a small metal plate) which oscillate after some time it comes to rest. Because of electromagnetic dampingneedle comes to rest quickly.As a result magnitude of current can be detected. It is same as metal plate entering the magnetic field there is a current induced similarly when leaving the magnetic field there is a current induced. The current entering and leaving are in opposite directions. These eddy currents oppose the relative motion as a result electromagnetic damping occurs.,"Definition, Reasoning"
"Induction is defined as current production in the coil due to the change in magnetic flux in itself or another coil. Types of Induction:- Self-induction- There will be change in the magnetic flux in the coil itself because of which a current will be induced in itself. It is denoted by L. Mutual induction- There are 2 coils,if there is change in the magnetic flux in one coil then the magnetic field is induced in the second coil. It is denoted by M.Inductance:- Inductance is a quantity which measures the induction. It is also called as Coefficient of induction.

"Self-Inductance. There is one coil in which there is change in the flux in that coil and because of that flux change. Current is induced in the same coil. Current tries to oppose the change in the flux. Consider a closed circuit,as a result the current will flow through the coil,therefore flux increases as a result current is induced in the coil. This induced current will oppose the growth of current. Suppose there is N number of turns in the coil.Therefore flux linkage of the coil N Φ∝ I. N Φ =LI where L=constant of proportionality and is known as self-inductance. Therefore Self-inductance will describe about the ratio of magnetic flux to the current it induces.

When the key is pressed attached to the coil 1 the current starts flowing, when the current starts increasing flux linked also starts increasing. Because of the increase in the flux linked with the coil1, the flux of coil 2 also increases. There is change in the flux of the coil 2 as a result emf is induced in the coil 2.

"Working:-
At initial time t=0;θ =0 where θ = angle between magnetic field (B) and area vector.

When the coil rotates with the angular velocity ω;

Φ(t) =BA cosθ = BA cosωt (because θ is changing as a result magnetic flux is also changing)

The source of voltage is alternating as is represented as V = Vm sinωt.
In the circuit there is source voltage(V) and an inductor with inductance = L.
In this circuit there are no resistors. There is one source EMF i.e. is the source voltage and another emf is self-induced.
As current is changing therefore the magnetic flux associated with the current also changes.
According to Faraday’s Lenz’s law whenever there is change in the flux a current is induced or an EMF is induced in the inductor.
As a result there will be self-induced EMF in the inductor which will oppose the change which is causing it.
Therefore V + e = 0.
Where V = source voltage and e = self- induced emf in the inductor L.
=> V - L(dI/dt) = 0 . Using e = -L (dI/dt)
=> Vm sinωt - L(dI/dt) = 0.
=>dI = (Vm sinωt dt /L)
Integrating both sides , therefore 0I∫dI = ∫ (Vm sinωt dt /L)
After simplifying, I = (Vm/L) [ -cosωt/ω] + constant
I = - (Vm/ ω L) cosωt + 0
(constant = 0 because as source voltage oscillate symmetrically about 0, therefore current should also oscillate about 0.)

"Alternating Transformer



Principle:-

Transformers work on the principle of Mutual induction.

Mutual Induction :- Suppose there are 2 inductors if some current flows through coil(1) ,there will be change in the current as a result there will be change in the magnetic flux, as a result there will be  change in the magnetic flux in the coil (2) and because of which emf is induced in the coil(2).

Construction:-

A Transformer consists of  :-

Primary coil:-
Primary coil has ‘n’ number of turns of wire over a piece of soft iron core.
It is the input end.
Secondary coil :-
Secondary coil has ‘n’ number of turns of any wire(like copper etc.) .
It is the output end as we receive output from this end.
Soft iron core :-
The hysteresis curve for iron is extremely thin because of which it covers minimum possible area.
As the  area  of  the  hysteresis  loop  of  iron is very less  therefore the energy lost by the transformer will be very less.
Permanent magnet is not suitable to use in transformers because the energy lost will be huge.


Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:

(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.



Working :-

An input voltage(AC source)  is applied across the primary coil. As  a result alternating current is produced in the primary coil.
The alternating current will give rise to alternating flux is produced in the coils.
Because of change in the magnetic flux emf will be induced .
There will be 2 Emfs produced in the circuit. 1. Self –induction 2. Mutual induction.
There will be self - induced emf in the primary coil , because of change in the magnetic flux in the primary coil there will be corresponding change in the magnetic flux  associated with the secondary coil which will give rise to induced emf in the secondary coil.
Mutual induction takes place in the secondary coil.
Induced emf in the primary coil = ep = -Np (df/dt)  
Where (df/dt) = rate of change magnetic flux and Np = number of turns in the primary coil.
Mutual induction in the secondary coil es = - Ns (df/dt)
Where Ns = number of turns in the secondary coil.
Assuming  resistance =0 in both primary and secondary coils.
Therefore ep = Vp (Voltage across primary coil)  
Vp = -Np (df/dt)  (equation(1))  and
es = Vs (Voltage across secondary coil) = - Ns (df/dt)  (equation(2))
Dividing equation(1) with (2):-
(Vp/Vs) = (Np/ Ns)
=>  Vs = (Ns/ Np) Vp
Power at the input end is same as the power at the output end.
Therefore Pintput = Poutput
=> IpVp =  IsVs",Reasoning
"Types of Transformers

There are 2 types of transformers:-

Step up transformer:-

This transformer amplifies the voltage. The output is higher than the input which is being supplied.
This condition will be true Vs > Vp only when  Ns > Np and Ip < Is.
Vs = (Ns/ Np) Vp
The output of the transformer à  voltage will be high and current will be less.
They are used in the power stations which supply power to the houses.


Step down transformer:-

For Vs < Vp  to be true then  Ns < Np .
Is > Ip so  that (Pintput  = Poutput).
Output is low voltage and high current.
This transformer is used in welding
","Definition, Reasoning"
"Applications of Transformers

Transmission of power over long distances :-

Suppose there is a main power station, from there power is send to different sub area power stations and from there it is supplied to different houses.
At the main power station there is step-up transformer, it will amplify the voltage and current is reduced.
When the current is reduced therefore heating will be reduced to a great extent.
The power loss is minimized to a great extent till it reaches the area sub stations.
At the area substation step-down transformer is used. This transformer will reduce the voltage and then supplied to the houses.
The line power loss will be not very much as the distance between the houses and area power substation won’t be very large.


Transformers are used to regulate the voltage. Many appliances use voltage stabilizers which regulate the voltage so that the electronic devices are not harmed when there is fluctuation in the voltage.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Energy losses in actual transformers

Flux leakage:-

 There are air gaps between the primary and the secondary coils  because of which the change of flux which is associated with the primary coil is not completely transferred to secondary coil.
In order to reduce the loss secondary coil can be wound over the primary coil.
For example:- In case of toroidal transformer cores, over the primary coil secondary coil is wound above it. As a result there is no air gap in between them.
","Definition, Examples"
"Resistance of windings:-

The wire used for the windings has some resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire (I2R).
 If the area of the cross section of the wire is increased then the resistance will be reduced considerably.
So the thick wires are used in the windings of primary and secondary coils as a result resistance will be less .
The amount of heat lost because of wires will be less as resistance is minimal.
Eddy currents:-

Soft Iron core also gets heated up because of magnetic flux as a result eddy currents are developed in the soft iron core.
Core gets heated up because of eddy currents. This will harm the transformer core.
In order to prevent this laminated core can be used. Because of insulated covering eddy  currents are not able to produce the heating effects.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Hysteresis:-

There is energy loss involved during the magnetisation of the material of the core.
Always those materials are to be chosen for which hysteresis loss is minimum.
That is why Soft Iron core is used instead of permanent magnets.",Definition

"Huygens Theory

According to Huygens light can be of wave nature.


He got this idea from the simple observation:
In an experiment conducted by Newton and Huygens, two rooms were considered with an obstruction in the middle. Newton considered a boundary and Huygens considered a door as the obstacle between rooms. In this experiment, light was switched on in one room.
According to Newton if light travels in straight lines then first room will be bright and some portions of the second room will become bright and the rest of the room will be dark.
Huygens observed that the first room became bright and the light spread in the second room as well, but it was not as bright as the first room.
Therefore Huygens’s proposed that light might be of a wave nature.
As the wavelength of light is so small thereforethe wave nature of light cannot be seen.
If the light is made to pass through a small portion which is comparable to the wavelength of light,then the wave nature of the light can be observed.
According to Huygens, Newton’s theory was not fully correct.Therefore he gave an idea that the light is of wave nature.
For example:-
If a light is made to pass through a big window then the light will appear as ray and not the wave.
But if the light is made to pass through a very small hole then the wave nature can be observed.
Huygens’s idea was not accepted because of the following reasons:-
As there was no experimental proof of what Huygens proposed.
There was Newton’s authority at that time.
Wave always needs a medium for propagation. This means light cannot propagate in vacuum.But sunlight is able to reach earth surface.

"Using Huygens principle we can determine the new position of the wavefront after time t.
Mathematically: To calculate the new position of the wavefront after time t.
Let the initial time ti =0.
Each wave will travel =vt1where v=speed of the wave.
Distance travelled by each wave is equal to the radius of the sphere.
Therefore radius of sphere = v t1.
Common tangent joining all the spheres will give the position of the new wavefront at time t=t1.
There are 2 possibilities: - outer tangent and inner tangent.
The amplitude of the back wave is 0. Therefore the back wave is neglected and the forward wave was considered.
New wave front will arise from each point on the outer wavefront.
Therefore the distance covered by these wavefronts = vt2.
And again spheres will be obtained and by drawing common tangent will tell the position of all the new wavefront after time t2.
Again back wave is neglected and forward wavefront is considered.
This shows the wavefront keep on spreading with time.",Reasoning 
"Reflection of plane waves

When all the points on an incident wave which are in same phase are considered together, incident wave front will be obtained.
After reflection incident waves will bounce back.
Waves which are lighter will touch the surface before the waves which are denser.
Let the time taken by some portion of wavefront to interact with the boundary is τ.
As soon as incident wavefront touches the boundary, every point on the incident wavefront will give rise to secondary wavelets.
The wavefront for the secondary wavelets will be a sphere.
After some time t1 incident ray is at some other point, again it will give rise to wavefront.
Radius of the wavefront = velocity (speed) of the wave x time taken=vxτ.
When other points interact with the boundary gradually, both τand radius will keep decreasing.
As a result the tangent of all these points will give rise to reflected wavefront.
Mathematically:-
Speed of the wave =v
Time taken by B to reach point C i.e. BC= vx τ
At point A it will give rise to secondary waves, therefore radius=vτ.
After some time τ will keep on decreasing.
Therefore as it moves towards the point C the radius of the sphere (wavefront) will keep on decreasing.

Waves in denser medium will have lesser velocity as compared to velocity in rarer medium.It is given as v2τ.
The wavefront will not be a circle as the waves in two different mediums are travelling with different velocities.
To prove Snell’s law:-
Consider two triangle’s ABC and AEC :-
In triangle ABC sin i= (BC/AC) and sin r=(AE/AC)
 By dividing (sin i/sin r) = (BC/AC) x (AC/AE)
Therefore (sin i/sin r) = (BC/AE) =(v1τ) /(v2τ)
=> (sin i/sin r) =(v1/v2)
Refractive index n; =(c/V) 
Where c = velocity of light in vacuum and V=velocity of light in medium.
Therefore (sin i/sin r) = (c/n1)/(c/n2)
Where n1 and n2 are the refractive index in medium 1 and 2 resp.
Snell’s law (sin i/sin r) = (n1/ n2). Hence proved.
Case 1: Angle of incidence is greater than angle of refraction, i>r
Light rays bend towards the normal when it travels from rarer medium to denser medium.
=> v1> v2
Where v1 = velocity in denser medium and v2 =velocity in rarer medium.
Case 2: Angle of incidence is less than angle of refraction, i<r.
Light rays bend away from the normal when it travels from denser medium to rarer medium.
=>v1< v2
Conclusion: Velocity in rarer medium > Velocity in denser medium.
This is contrary to Newton’s theory.
Huygens theory was able to prove all the laws of refraction. That is why his theory was accepted.
Case 2:- Denser medium to rarer medium.
In refraction any point of the incident wavefront interacts with boundary, secondary waves will be formed and these secondary waves will have some velocity.
Velocity in denser medium is lesser than the velocity in the rarer medium, i.e.v1< v2.
=> Radius of wavefronts in rarer medium < Radiusof wavefronts in denser medium.","Definition, Reasoning "

"Concave mirror:-
The concave mirror converges the incident wavefront at the focus which is at the same side.
Effects ofPrism,convex lens and concave mirrorcan be explained in terms of wave front.
According to Huygens velocity of the light in the denser medium is lesser than the velocity in the rarer medium.
In a prism or convex lens, velocity of wavefront inside them is lesser than the velocity outside.
Consider the fig the wave (1) will travel a very little portion of the denser medium whereas wave (2) will travel more portion of the rarer medium.
This means the velocity of wave (2) is less for longer period of time because of which they take more time to come out of the prism.
Wave (1) travel with lesser speed for small amount of time. So they reach faster.
In case of convex lens the waves which are in middle will travel maximum portion of the denser medium. Therefore they travel more time in the denser medium.
They have less velocity as a result they will take more time as compared to the waves at the edges.
As the lens is thinner at both the edges.","Definition, Reasoning "
"Doppler’s effect

Doppler Effect is the shift in frequency of light when there is relative motion between the source and observer.
It is used to measure the speed of a receding object.
When the source is moving away from the observer then the wavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer.
When a star is moving away from the earth the wavelength in the middle of the visible region of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum.
As a result star looks more reddish when moves away from the earth.
This is known as red shift phenomenon.
When the waves are received from a sourcemoving towards the observer, there is an apparent decrease in wavelength. This is called blue shift.
The fractional change in frequency (Δν/ν)=(–vradial/c),
Where vradial= component of the source velocity along the line joining the
observer to the source; vradial is considered positive when the source moves away from the observer.
Thus, the Doppler shift can be expressed as:
(Δν/ν) = (–vradial/c);
It is valid when the speed of the source is small compared to that of light.","Definition, Formula"

Superposition of waves is defined as the resultant displacement produced by a number of waves is the vector sum of displacements produced by each of them.

There are 2 types of superposition:-
Constructive overlap:-When two waves overlap to produce a bigger wave that is known as constructive overlap.

For constructive overlap both the waves are in phase with each other.

"Constructive Overlap

Case 1:-
Consider two coherent sources S1 and S2emitting light waves of same frequency and constant phase.
The wave fronts of both the sources will overlap with each other.

"Conclusion: -
If a point is equidistant from two sources then the
Amplitude as well as the intensity increases.
Path difference is defined as the difference in the paths from both the sources to a particular point.
This implies S2P - S1P =0.
If the path difference is 0 then it will be constructive overlap.
Case 2:- Considering a point Q which is not equidistant from the 2 sources and the path difference S1Q - S2Q = 2λ(integral multiple)
=> As S1Q > S2Q therefore the waves originating from S1 have to travel a greater path than S2.
Therefore waves from S2 will reach exactly 2 cycles earlier than waves from S1. Waves reach at S2early by 2λ as compared to S1.
One cycle corresponds to λ and two cycles correspond to 2λ.

"Interference

Interference is a phenomenon of superposition of 2 waves to form a resultant wave of greater, lower or the same amplitude.
When the crest of a wave overlaps the crest of another wave of the same frequency at the same point, then the resultant amplitude will be the sum of the amplitudes of individual waves. Then it is known as constructive interference.
Amplitude of the resultant wave will be more as compared to the amplitude of individual waves.
When the crest of one wave meets the trough of another wave,then the resultant amplitude is given as difference of the two individual amplitudes.Then it is known as destructive interference.
Amplitude of the resultant wave will be less as compared to the amplitude of individual waves.

If two stones are dropped in the river,ripples or wavesare generated by both stones.When both the waves overlap,there will be maximum displacement when the waves are in phase and there will be no displacement when they are out of phase.","Definitoin, Examples"
"Young’s double slit experiment (YDSE)

The Young’s experiment shows that matter and energy can display both wave and particle characteristics.

Purpose of double slit experiment is as follows:-

In order to prove the wave nature of light.
To explain the phenomenon of interference.
Two coherent sources of light were taken in order to maintain the 0 or constant phase difference between the sources of light.

Experimental set-up1:-
Young took an ordinary source of light(S) such as light bulb.
The light was made to pass through a very small slit S (which was comparable with the wavelength of light).
The light coming from Source S was made to pass through two small slits S1 and S2 which were separated by a very small distance d.
One screen was kept in front of these 2 sources.
Observation1:-

He observed alternate dark and light bands were formed on the screen.
Setup 2:-

Now he took 2 light bulbs i.e. 2 non coherent sources of light and placed a screen in front of them.
Observation 2:-

He observed there were no alternate bands of light formed on the screen.
Conclusion:-
When coherent sources of light were taken then the phenomenon of interference is taking place.
When non-coherent sources were taken phenomenon of interference was not taking place.
The source S illuminated the sources S1 and S2 as a result the light from S1 and S2 become coherent.
S was the source of bothS1 and S2, therefore if there is any change in the phase of the source there will be change in the both sources also.
Therefore both S1 and S2 will be always in phase with each other.",Reasoning
"Why alternate sources of light bands were seen

When the ordinary light source was made to pass through small slit then the wavefront of semicircle shape will be formed.
Wavefronts are in semicircle shape because of obstacles on both the sides.
In the figure red bands represents crests and yellow represents troughs.
When these wavefronts passes through the 2 small slits again the wavefronts will arise.
There will be points where red and yellow will also overlap with each other.
Red + Yellow and Yellow + Red à  Destructive interference à Intensity low
Yellow + Yellow and Red + Red à Constructive interference à Intensity high
Because of constructive and destructive interference there are alternate dark and light bands seen on the screen.
Conclusion: -
When the light wave is originating from the 2 coherent sources they overlap with each other both constructively and destructively.
As a result alternate light and dark bands of light is shown on the screen.
This phenomenon of overlapping of light waves giving rise to regions of higher amplitude and regions of lower amplitudeis known as interference.
Interference is a property related to the wave nature of the light.
Young’s Double slit experiment proved that the light is of wave nature which was proposed by Huygens principle.
 

Important resultsdrawn from the above experiment:-
Bands were formed as a result of interference and interference was due to the overlapping (either constructive or destructive) of waves.
Constructive and destructive overlapping depends on the path difference.
If the path difference is integral multiple of λ = constructive interference.
If path difference is non integral multiple of λ =destructive interference.
Calculation of path difference

Let S1 and S2 are the sources and consider a point P where we have to calculate the intensity.
Path difference = S2P-S1P
Using Pythagoras theorem :- (S1P) 2 = D2 + (x-(d/2)) 2 equation(1)
Where D=distance of the screen from 2 slits, x= position of the point where intensity has to be found.
Similarly (S2P)2 = D2+ (x+(d/2)) 2 equation(2)
Where d=distance between the 2 small slits.
Subtracting (2) and (1) => (S2P)2 - (S1P) 2 =(x+(d/2)) 2 - (x-(d/2)) 2
On simplifying (S2P)2 - (S1P) 2 =2xd
=> (S2P+S1P)(S2P- S1P)=2xd
=>(S2P- S1P) =(2xd)/(S2P+S1P)
If d<<D ; x<<D(screen is placed quite far away from the slit arrangement)
=> (S2P+S1P) (are almost same as D).
=> S2P+S1P =2D
Therefore (S2P- S1P) = (2xd)/(2D)
Path difference =(xd)/(D)Equation(2)
 

Observation:-

Light from coherent sources produced alternate dark and bright bands on the screen placed some distance away from it.",Reasoning
The alternate dark and red bands which are obtained on the screen are known as fringe pattern and the alternate dark and bright bands are known as fringes.,Definition
"Bright Bands:-
Bright bands are formed as a result of constructive interference and they are the positions of maximum intensity.
Condition for maximum intensity:-
Path difference =n λ.
=>(xd/D) = nλ using Equation(2)
=>xn = ((n λ D)/d) where xn=position of nth bright band.
When n=0 then it will be central bright band.","Definition, Formula"
"Dark Bands:-
Dark bands are formed by the destructive interference and they are the positions of minimum intensity.
Condition for destructive interference:-
Path difference =(n+(1/2))λ
=> (xd/D) = (n+ (1/2)) λ.
=>xn=(n+ (1/2)) (λD/d)
Where xn=position of nth dark band.","Deinition, Formula"
" Fringe width:-

Fringe width is the distance between consecutive dark and bright fringes.
It is denoted by ‘β’.
In case of constructive interference fringe width remains constant throughout.
It is also known as linear fringe width.
Angular Fringe width:-

It is the angle subtended by a dark or bright fringe at the centre of the 2 slits.
It is denoted by ‘θ’.
Mathematical Expression for fringe width(β):-
xn =((nλD)/d)
xn+1 =(((n+1)λD)/d)
β =xn+1 - xn
=(((n+1) λD)/d) – ((nλD)/d)
=>β = (λD/d)
Therefore fringe width depends on:-
(λ)Wavelength of the light used, (D) distance of the screen from the slits and (d) distance between two slits.

θ = (λD)/(d D)

"Conclusion of Young’s double slit experiment

Central fringes gets shifted by – θ if the source gets shifted by θ.
If the source S is shifted by some angle θ, there will be no change in fringe pattern. The central fringe will get shifted in the opposite direction.
Intensity of the fringes increase if point sources are replaced with slits.
If there are slits instead of point source then more light waves will be able to pass through the slits.
As a result stronger wavefronts are formedwhich give rise to even greater intensity fringes.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Sustained Interference

Sustained interference means positions of maxima and minima of light intensity remain fixed throughout the screen.
The intensity of the light remains same throughout.
In case of sustained interference the phenomenon of interference is permanent.
Therefore sustained interference is also known as permanent interference.",Definition
"Conditions for sustained interference:-

Sources should be coherent.
If the sources are not coherent then there will no fixed pattern of constructive and destructive interference.
Sources should be very close to each other.

"Diffraction

Diffraction is the phenomenon by virtue of whichlight bendswhile passing through aslit or an opening.
The extent of bending depends upon the diameter of the slit.
Both Interference and Diffraction are closely related to each other.
Young replaced the two slits by a single slit in his single slit experiment.Therefore this experiment is also referred as Young’s single slit experiment.
When the light passed through one slit a different type of pattern was observed on the screen.
The pattern which was observed had a central maximum band and which was very wide as compared to interference pattern.
There were alternate dark and bright bands and their intensity was decreasing on both the sides.
The central maxima,was very wide whereas corresponding secondary maxima and minima were reduced in the intensity.
The change in the pattern was formed due to diffraction instead of interference.
Conclusion:-

Broad central bright band.
Alternate dark and bright bands on either side.
Intensity was decreasing on both sides.

Diffraction Fringe Pattern

In diffraction there is an incoming wave which passes through a single slit and as a result diffraction pattern was obtained on the screen.
  

Diffraction pattern Maxima

The incident wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit. This shows they are in phase with each other.
From the given figure:-
Path difference =NP – LP
=>NQ = a sinθ where a=width of the slit.
The slit was divided into smaller parts M1, M2, N and L, and when contribution from each part is added up.
At the central point θ =0. This implies path difference =0.
This means all the parts of the slit will contribute completely. Therefore the intensity is the maximum.
Central Maximum occurs at θ =0.
 

Problem:-The light of wavelength 600nm is incident normally on a slit of width 3mm.Calcluate the linear width of central maximum on a screen kept 3m away from the slit?

Answer:-

Wavelength λ =600nm =600 x10-9m.

Width of the slit a =3mm=3x10-3m.

Distance of the screen D=3m.

Condition for minima:-a sinθ =nλ

=>a sin θ =λ

=>sin θ = (λ/a) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=>θ =(600 x10-9)/(3x10-3)

=>(x/D) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=> x= (600 x 10-9 x3)/ (3 x10-3)

x=600 x 10-6m.

Therefore width =2x = 1200 x 10-6m

Width = 1.2 mm

Diffraction pattern Secondary Maxima

Scientist Fresnel found that secondary maxima occurred when the value of θ is:

θ =(n+(1/2)) (λ/a)
For n=1 =>θ =(3λ)/(2a) = (1.5λ/a) (equation 1)
Where = (3λ)/ (2a) it lies midway between 2 dark fringes.
Suppose if the slit is divided into 3 parts ,
Consider the first 2/3rd part of the slit ,
Path difference = (2/3) a x θ
=(2/3) a x(3λ/2a) using (equation 1)
Path difference =λ.
The λ is getting divide into 2 halves with path difference =λ/2 and λ/2.
Each of λ/2 gets cancel with another λ/2.
Contribution from (2/3rd) part gets cancel out with each other.
Therefore only (1/3rd) contributes to I(Intensity).
Intensity ≠ 0.
Intensity is reduced.
For n=2 => θ =(5 λ)/(a)
Only (1/5th) part will contribute.
For n=3 =>θ =(7 λ)/(2a)
Only (1/7th) part contributes.
 

Slit divided into 3 parts

 

Diffraction pattern for Minima

Condition to get minima on the diffraction pattern:
θ = (n λ/a); n= (+-) 1, (+-2)…
For n=1, =>θ = (λ/a)
Suppose the slit is divided into small parts. For every M1in the portion LM there exists another M2 in MN.
From the figure it is clear that the contribution from all elements inLM (M1) will cancel out the contribution from all elements MN (M2).
Therefore net intensity I=0 at θ = (λ/a).
Minima occur at θ = (nλ/a). => aθ =nλ
=> a sinθ =nλ.
Path difference = (nλ/a).
Minima will occur ata sin θ =n λ. Where a =width of the slit,λ = wavelength of the light used.","Definiiton, Reasoning"

"Resolving Power of Optical instruments

Resolving power is defined as the inverse of the distance between two objects which can be just resolved when viewed through the optical instrument.
Optical instruments should be able to display two separate images as distinct two separate images.
Suppose if we are seeing 2 stars in the sky using telescope, and they are very closely placed to each other, they should not be displaced as one star.
Instead they should be displaced as two separate stars. The ability to see them as separate 2 stars is known as resolving power.
For example: -
Consider 2 rooms one is lit and another is dark.The room which is lit we are able to see everything clearly whereas in second room we are not able to see properly.
This is because the resolving power with which we are viewing second room is not good.

"Diffraction in resolving power of telescope

In telescope resolving power plays an important role.
In telescope there are 2 lenses one is objective lens and other is eye-piece.
The purpose of objective lens to create an image at the second focal length of the objective and the first focal length of eyepiece.
The image which iscreated will be inverted and diminished.
The purpose of eye-piece is just to enlarge the image formed by the objective lens at the focal length.
The purpose of objective lens is to resolve images as distinct.
For example: -
If we are viewing 2 different stars the purpose of objective lens will be to resolve the stars as 2 distinct stars.
Whenever a ray of light passes through the objective lens it should get focus at a particular point.
But because of the phenomenon of diffraction instead of focussing at a specific point the image gets focussed in and around that area.
Limit of Resolution :
Limit of resolution is defined as the angle subtended by the distant objects on the objective.
This means how small an object can be resolved by the telescope.
It is denoted by dθ.
Case 1:-The limit of resolution is 0.2 radians.
That is telescope can resolve up to 0.2 radians.
Case2:- The limit of resolution is 20 radians.
The telescope can resolve up to 20 radians.
Lesser the limit of resolution better is the resolving power.
Resolving Power (R.P) ∝ (1/dθ).
dθ∝ (λ/D)
=>Limit of resolutiondθ =(1.22 λ/D)
Whereλ =wavelength of the wave, D =diameter of the objective lens.
If the diameter of the objective lens is large then more and more light can pass through it.
As a result telescope will be able to give more detailed image.
Resolving Power:
Resolving power is defined as the relationship between limit of resolution and resolving power.
Resolving Power (R.P) ∝(1/dθ).
dθ ∝ (λ/D)
Where diameter of the aperture of the convex lens D = (2a) and f=focal length of the lens.
When a parallel beam of light is incident on the convex lens it should get focussed at one single point.
But diffraction occurs when the distance measured is comparable to the wavelength of the light.
Therefore instead of single point a spotappears. This spot appears because of diffraction.
There will be one central maximum surrounded by dark band (minima) then secondary maxima and then secondary minima.
Experimentally the radius of Central maxima= (1.22λ/D).
P of a telescope ∝(D/1.22λ).
Conclusion:-A telescope must have a larger diameter objective for better resolution.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Diffraction in resolving power of Microscope

In case of microscope resolving power helps to magnify the image.
Resolution helps to distinguish between the small similar particles of an object when they are so closely placed with each other.
When the distance between 2 points is comparable to the wavelength then diffraction occurs.
Image formed due to the diffraction pattern vθ = v (22λ/D).
The minimum distance for the object to be resolved is v (22 λ)/(D)andbeyond this point the object cannot be resolved.
Minimum separation between objects to get resolved is given as:-
dmin = (v (1.22λ/D))/m  
Where m =magnification.
dmin= (1.22λ/D) f;
Where f=focal length.
tanβ = (D/2f)
Whereβ = angle made by the objective lens at its focus, D=diameter and f=focus.
tanβ = 1.22f λ
Therefore dmin = (1.22λ)/(tanβ)
dmin= (1.22λ)/(2tanβ) if β≈ small, tanβ≈ sinβ≈β
dmin= (1.22 λ)/(2 sin β)
Suppose if the medium between the object and the objective lens has refractive index n.
dmin= (1.22λ)/ (2n sinβ) where n sinβ = numerical aperture of objective lens.
Therefore dmin= (1.22λ)/ (2n sinβ) is known as numerical aperture of the objective lens.
Resolving Power(R.P) of a microscope ∝ (1/dmin).
This implies resolving power decreases as the distance increases.
=>P. =(2n sin β)/(1.22 λ)
Conclusion:-Resolving power can be increased by choosing medium of higher refractive index.",Reasoning
"Validity of wave optics

There will be centralmaxima due to diffraction.
Angular size of central maximum = (λ/a)

The spread is given as = (z λ/a)
Where (z λ/a) = a where a =width of the diffracted beam.

Fresnel distance describes the distance at which spread due to diffraction becomes comparable to the width of the slit or not.
This is the boundary of ray optics and wave optics.

"Polarizing and unpolarized light wave

Polarized wave: - Polarized wave is defined as the vibration of the wave confined to specific plane.
 

In case of polarized wave the vibrations takes place in one plane not in multiple planes and it is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
For example: -
Vibrations of a rubber. It will vibrate randomly in all different directions. But when it is passed through a small slit then it will vibrate only in one plane.
 

Unpolarized wave:-Unpolarized wave is defined as the plane of vibration which changes randomly in short intervals of time.
In case of unpolarized wave the vibrations takes place in multiple planes and it is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
 

What is polarization?

Polarization is the process of transforming unpolarized light into polarized light.

Methods of polarization:-

Polarization by Scattering
Polarization by Reflection

Polarization: Transverse vs. Longitudinal waves

In case of transverse waves there are many different ways in which particles can oscillate.

Every Polaroid has pass axis. Pass axis is like a gate of aPolaroid which determines how the light will pass through it.
There is horizontal as well as vertical pass axis.

"Experiment 1:-Polarization by a single polaroid (P1)

When a beam of light passes through Polaroid was a polarized light.
Observations:

The intensity was almost halved. As half of light rays were not allowed to enter only few were allowed to pass through it.
Rotation of thePolaroid P1 has no effect on the intensity of transmitted light.
There will be many different orientations but all are present in equal amount.
Whatever is the direction of the Polaroidbut always the intensity of the lightcoming out of the Polaroid will be same.
Sometimes it will allow vertically polarized light to pass and sometimes horizontal.",Reasoning
"Experiment 2:-Polarization by a two polaroid (P1,P2)

One more Polaroid(P2) was introduced in between the unpolarized light and Polaroid(P1).
Observations:

Intensity of the light is almost halved after P2.
When the polarized light enters the second Polaroid (P1) then
If the pass axis of the polarizer P1 is along the same direction as P2 then the light will come out of the Polaroid P1.
Intensity will remain same.
Rotation of the Polaroid P1 has effects on intensity of transmitted polarized light.
When the two axes are not oriented in the same direction i.e. if the axis of the P1 is perpendicular to the axis of the P2.
Then P1 won’t allow any light to pass through it as a result net intensity will be 0.
It concludes that :-
Transmitted intensity=0 when pass axis of P1 is perpendicular to P2.
Transmitted intensity=maximum when pass axis of P1 is parallel to P2.",Reasoning
"Polaroid Experiment:Conclusion

Intensity of the polarized light varies with the angle between the pass axes of the two Polaroid.
I =0 whenθ =900.
I =max when θ=00.
As the angle increases from 00 to 900 the intensity keeps on decreasing.

Experimentally it was found that intensity varies as cos2θ ;
I=I0 cos2θ.
Where θ =angle between the pass axes of two Polaroids, I0=Intensity of polarized light after passing through P1 and I =new intensity after rotation.","Definition, Formula"

"Polarization by reflection and refraction

When an unpolarized beam of light falls on boundary, reflected wave and refracted wave are partially polarized.
An incident wave is an unpolarized light .Some of the rays will get reflected and some gets refracted.
Most of the light waves that reflected were polarized waves, which were parallel to the plane.
Most of the rays along the refracted ray were unpolarized waves with one or two polarized components.
Refracted Ray à More unpolarized and Reflected rayà more polarized.
If the angle of incidence varies more and more unpolarized light was able to pass through the surface.
At one particular value of angle of incidence there was maximumpolarization in the reflected ray.
Above and below the value of angle of incidence, both reflected and refracted rays were partially polarized.
Brewster’s law:- Brewster’s law states that at any particular angle of incidence, reflected ray is completely polarized; and the angle between reflected and refracted ray is 900.

 

At i = iB; where iB = Brewster’s angle of incidence.
From Snell’s law :- (sin i/sin r)= μ
=> sin iB /(sin (π/2 -iB))
=>(sin iB /cos iB)=μ

"ROADMAP TO THE DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON:
William Crookes, in 1870, discovered that on applying a strong electric field between cathode and anode (kept under discharge tube at low pressures), some rays were emitted by the cathode. These rays were noticed as a bright fluorescent on the glass adjacent to the cathode
These rays were called as cathode rays by William Crookes
In 1879, he proposed that these cathode rays are a bunch of fast moving negatively charged particles
Then, J. Thomson (1856-1940) validated the above hypothesis. He found that when ultraviolet radiation falls on a metal surface (or when metal surface is heated), few negatively charged particles are released by the metal surface.
He used electric and magnetic fields (across the discharge tube), mutually perpendicular to each other and the emitted electrons
He was the first to find the values of; speed(v), and the charge to mass ratio (e/m) of the cathode ray particles, experimentally
He found the speed of particles to be about 0.1 to 0.2 times the speed of light (), and the charge to mass ratio (e/m)
He also found that the e/m ratio to be constant, irrespective of the material used as an emitter. This proved the universal nature of cathode ray particles.
In 1897, he termed this negatively charged cathode ray particles as electron, and this name was used for the first time.
A. MIlikan, in 1913 performed experiments to calculate the charge on an oil drop (popularly known as Milikan’s oil drop experiment)
He observed that, every time the charge came to be an integral(whole number) multiple of a small charge (), which is actually the charge on an electron
MIlikan concluded that charge on a matter is quantized (discrete)","Property, Reasoning, Definition"
"ELECTRON EMISSION:
The process of emission of electrons from the metal surface when a certain amount of energy is absorbed by the metal, is called electron emission
There are free electrons on the metal surface, present in the outermost (valence) shell that are loosely bound to the nucleus
These electrons are emitted when a certain minimum amount of external energy is provided to the metal surface. This least value of energy is called work function of metal (denoted by Φ0)
The unit of Φ0 is electron volt(eV). 1eV is defined as the energy needed to accelerate an electron through the potential difference of 1volt(V).
Work function of a material depends mainly on the nature of metal, and electronic configuration of metal (meaning the number of valence shell electrons, lesser the number, lesser the work function)","Definition, Property, Relation"
"TYPES OF ELECTRON EMISSION:
There are 3 types of electron emission; a) thermionic emission, b) field emission, and c) photoelectric emission

Thermionic emission:
Thermionic emission is the process in which thermal energy is used to overcome the work function of metal in order to force out the free electrons from the metal surface. It is used in thermionic converter
In thermionic converter, comparatively hot electrode emits electrons on receiving thermal energy. These electrons move towards the comparatively cold electrode, thus producing thermionic current (and power).
Field Emission:
Field emission is the process where free electrons are forced out of metal surface using a strong electric field ()
It is used in field electron microscopes, vacuum nano electronics and other such fields of study.
Photoelectric Emission:
Photoelectric emission is the process where free electrons are removed from a metal surface using a light of certain frequency on that metal
It is used in image sensor (where optical image is transformed into electric signals), applied mainly in digital cameras.
It is also used in gold leaf electroscope,used to detect and measure static electricity.

"PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT- A BRIEF HISTORY:
Hertz, in 1887 discovered the phenomena of photoelectric effect for the first time
As he was experimenting on the generation of electromagnetic waves by spark discharge, he noticed that sparks around the detector loop were intensified when ultraviolet radiation fell on the emitter plate
Radiation falling on the metal surface provided free electrons enough energy to neutralize the attractive force of positive ions and escape themetal surface to intensify the sparks across the metal loop.


Hallwach and Lenard during 1886-1902, researched the process of photoelectric emission
They experimented on negatively charged zinc plate and found that on absorbing ultraviolet light zinc plate became neutral, losing its net positive charge. On further absorption of ultraviolet radiation, neutral zinc plate became negatively charged.
This proved that electrons are released from the metal surface when ultraviolet radiation is incident on it
They also observed that electrons are not emitted when the frequency of light incident is less than a specific least value, called the threshold frequency. Threshold frequency depends on the nature of material used as an emitter
Some metals like zinc, magnesium etc. emitted electrons only by absorbing ultraviolet light. But, alkali metals like sodium potassium etc. could also absorb visible radiation to emit electrons, and so they were called photosensitive materials.
So, the process in which falling of electromagnetic radiation on the metal surface results in the emission of electrons is called photoelectric effect. And the electrons released due to photoelectric effect are called photoelectrons","Definition, Property, Relation, Reasoning, Examples"
"EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT:
 

The experimental setup consists of:

Evacuated tube consist of photosensitive plate (emitter) and the metal plate (collector), so that electrons could freely flow from emitter to collector without any air resistance
Photosensitive plate (emitter) to absorb visible light and emit electrons
Metal plate (collector) to receive electrons emitted from the emitter, thus constituting a photoelectric current flowfrom collector plate to the emitter plate (opposite to the flow of electrons)
Monochromatic light of short wavelength (meaning high frequency)
Battery to accelerate emitted electrons through a potential difference
Voltmeter to measure the potential difference between the emitter and the collector plates due to photoelectric current flow
Ammeter to measure the value of photoelectric current.",Reasoning
"EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT:
Variation of photoelectric current with intensity of radiation absorbed:

When the values of photoelectric current were plotted against the different values for intensity of light, it was observed to be a straight line passing through the origin.
It proved that Photoelectric current, which is number of photoelectrons flowing per unit time, is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light


Variation of photoelectric current with the potential applied:

Case-1-When collector plate was kept at higher potential (accelerating potential) with respect to the emitter.

As the positive potential of collector rises, photoelectric current rises for a certain period of time because the electrons emitted experience a strong attractive force by the collector
On further increasing the positive potential, photoelectric current reaches a maximum value, beyond which it remains fixed even when positive potential is increased. This is because number of free electrons in a metal surface is always fixed.
This maximum value of photoelectric current beyond which it remains fixed, no matter how high the positive potential gets, is called the saturation current.
Case-2-When collector plate was kept at lower potential (retarding potential) with respect to the emitter.

As the negative potential of collector rises, photoelectric current falls. This is because the electrons emitted will experience a strong repulsive force from the collector
As the retarding potential is further increased, even the electrons having maximum kinetic energy will be repelled by the repulsive force of the collector, and hence, the photoelectric current becomes zero
This corresponding minimum value of retarding (negative) potential for which the photoelectric current becomes zero is called stopping potential, or cut-off potential. It is denoted by (V0).
Mathematically, stopping potential could be expressed as Kmax=eV0, V0=stopping potential, Kmax=kinetic energy, e=charge on an electron


Case-3-When the variation of photoelectric current was plotted against the potential for 3 different values of intensity of incident light (keeping the frequency constant).

It was observed that stopping potential was constant for all the values of intensity. Thus, stopping potential is independent on the intensity of incident light.
On the other hand, saturation current got higher for higher values of intensity of absorbed light


Variation of photoelectric current with the frequency of incident light:

The variation of photoelectric current was plotted against the potential for 3 different values of frequency of incident light (keeping the intensity constant)
It was observed that saturation current was constant for all the values of frequency. Thus, saturation current is independent on the frequency of incident light.
However, stopping potential got higher in the negative direction for higher values of frequency of absorbed light


It was also found that, after reaching a certain minimum frequency value, stopping potential followed a linear relationship with the frequency of incident light.
This minimum value of frequency of incident light required for photoelectric emission to take place was called as threshold frequency
The value of threshold frequency is fixed for a specific material, and it changes from one material to another","Reasoning, Relation, Formula, Property"
"RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
Photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light
Saturation current increases if intensity of radiation increases
Stopping potential doesn’t depend on the intensity of light


Sopping potential, and maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons, are linearly related to the frequency of incident light
For every material, there is a minimum value of frequency (threshold frequency) of incident light required for photoelectric emission to take place, below which no photoelectric effect occurs


Photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process, meaning there is no time lag between the incident light and the emission of free electrons (photoelectrons).","Property, Relation"
"PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT:
As per the wave theory, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron should be affected by the change in intensity. But, the experiments on photoelectric effect showed that maximum kinetic energy doesn’t depend on the change in intensity. So, this was the first inconsistency of the wave theory with the experiments.
Wave theory didn’t talk about the relation between stopping potential and the threshold frequency.It said only increasing the intensity could overcome the stopping potential. Here came the second inconsistency of wave theory with the experimental results.
According to the wave theory, photoelectric effect was not aninstantaneous process, it was time taking. This was the third inconsistency with the experiments.
The above three inconsistencies showed that wave theory of light could not explain the experimentally observed characteristics of photoelectric effect.","Reasoning, Property, Relation"
"EINSTEIN’S PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION:
Since wave theory could not explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein proposed a particle theory of light for the first time
He said that radiations are made up of specific and discrete packets of energy called as quanta of radiation energy. Each energy quantum has a value equal to hv, where h = Planck’s constant, and v = frequency of incident light
These specific packets of quanta of energy are known as photons
When a light of frequency(v) (having energyhv ) is incident on a metal surface of work function(Φo), 3 cases could be possible
Case-1-When (hv < Φo), i.e., energy of photon is less than the work function of metal , no photoelectric emission occurs
Case-2- When (hv = Φo), i.e., energy of photon is exactly same as the work function of metal, then electrons get enough energy to just escape the metal surface.
Case-3- When (hv > Φo),e., energy of photon is greater than the work function of metal. Then electron, apart from getting energy to escape the metal surface, the remaining energy is provided to the electron as kinetic energy. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
hv = Φo + Kmax

Here, Kmax is the maximum kinetic energy of a photoelectron

The above equation is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation
From the Einstein’s photoelectric equation, following points are clear:

Photoelectric current (i) is directly proportional to the intensity (I) of radiation. As the intensity rises, number of photons received by metal surface in a unit area per unit time rises, so number of electrons emitted rises, and hence, photoelectric current increases
                             I ∝ I
Since saturation current is just a maximum value of photoelectric current, saturation current gets higher with increasing intensity of incident light
For every metal, there exists a certain minimum frequency below which no photoelectric effect occurs. This frequency is called threshold frequency.
                       HVO = ΦO
Here, vo = frequency of incident light, Φo = work function of metal

Stopping potential (Vo) and Maximum kinetic energy (Kmax) doesn’t depend upon the intensity. Because intensity is the number of photons in unit area and unit time, and the photoelectric effect take place when one electron takes one photon
Stopping potential (Vo) and Maximum kinetic energy (Kmax) is directly proportional to the frequency (ν)
                        KMAX∝ V   VO∝ V
The relation between stopping potential, maximum kinetic energy and the frequency of incident light could be expressed mathematically as follows: using Einstein’s photoelectric equation

hv = Φo + Kmax

Kmax = hν - Φo

Also, Kmax = eVo

∴ eVo = hν - Φo

On rearranging the above equation:

Vo = (h/e)v + (Φo/e)
Photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process, meaning that there is no time gap between incident radiation and electron emission.","Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning, Definition"
"PHOTON PICTURE OF RADIATION:
Radiation can behave as a wave as well as a particle under different situations. And while interacting with matter, it behaves as a particle
Energy (E) of a photon is given by: E = hv = hc/λ
Here, v = frequency, λ = wavelength, c = speed of light, and h = Planck’s constant

Momentum (p) of a photon is given by: p = hv/c = h/λ
Here symbols have their usual meaning.

Photons of similar frequencies possess equal energies and equal momentums
Photons are electrically neutral (not having a net positive or negative charge)
In a photon-particle collision:
Total energy remains constant
Total momentum remains constant
Total number of photons may or may not be constant.
The photoelectric effect proves the particle nature of radiation. Whereas, the phenomena like interference, diffraction, and polarization proves the wave nature of light. Hence, we can say that radiation displays both, wave nature, and particle nature, meaning a radiation possesses wave-particle dualism.","Reasoning, Property, Relation, Formula, Examples"
"WAVE NATURE OF MATTER: DE BROGLIE’S HYPOTHESIS:
De Broglie proposed that if the radiations could possess dual nature, matters could also possess dual nature.

If we take an example of a car of mass= 900kg, moving with the velocity of 36km/hr (10m/s).

The wavelength associated with the car will be:





We can observe that the wavelength associated with the car is insignificant and can’t be detected experimentally.

Hence, for the macroscopic objects, the mass is so large that the matter wave associated with them becomes insignificant and negligible

Case-2- (Microscopic object)

If we take an electron, mass=9.1 X 10-31 kg, moving with the speed of light (3 X 108 m/s).

The wavelength associated with an electron will be:

"HEISENBERG’S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE:
This principle was in favor of the wave nature of matter
It stated that it is impossible to simultaneously evaluate the precise position and momentum of particle. There is always some probability in predicting the position and momentum of a particle. Mathematically, it can be written as:
                   (Δx)(Δp) ≥ h/(2π)

 

Considering the above equation, 2 cases are possible:

Case-1- If precise momentum(p) of an electron is known, then its wavelength by De Broglie’s hypothesis will be constant:
              λ = h/p

It means that the wavelength has a fixed value and the wave is extended infinitely throughout the wave. Hence, it is impossible to find the position of the wave.

Mathematically, if   p = fixed  , Then, Δp→0, Δx→∞



Case-2- If the wave is localized, having finite end points
A localized wave is shown below:



As we can see in the diagram, the wavelength (λ) is not fixed, so the momentum (p) is also not fixed.

Hence, there is uncertainty in both, momentum (p) and position (x).","Definition, Formula, Relation, Property"

The experiment was in strong agreement with De Broglie’s hypothesis
According to De Broglie’s hypothesis, matter wave is given by:

 

The experiment proved that electrons behave as a wave under specific conditions as the scattering of electron gave rise to the diffraction pattern
On putting the value of V= 55V (the value at which a strong peak was detected), we get



The wavelength calculated above using De Broglie’s hypothesis is equal to the wavelength observed in the Davisson and Germer experiment. So, Davisson and Germer experiment was consistent with De Broglie’s hypothesis.

Atom is the fundamental building block of matter having a confined positively charged nucleus at the center, surrounded by negatively charged electrons.Every inorganic, organic, or even synthetic object is made up of atoms.

"DALTON’S ATOMIC THEORY:
Atoms are the smallest constituents of matter and can’t be divided further(indivisible)
Atoms belonging to same matter have similar characteristics and mass; atoms of different matter have different properties and mass
Atoms are reoriented in a chemical reaction (not generated or destructed)

"THOMSON MODEL OF ATOM:
Atom is like a sphere where positive charge has uniform distribution throughout
Electrons are scattered inside in a way that  most stable electrostatic arrangement is achieved, meaning that minimum possible energy of the system should is achieved
Also known as watermelon model or plum pudding model or raisin bread model
It positively illustrated the net neutrality(equal positive and negative charges, so no net charge) of atom
It was inconsistent with the experiments conducted later and the discovery of neutron and proton.",Property
"RUTHERFORD’S NUCLEAR MODEL OF ATOM:
Geiger and Marsden carried out few experiments on the advice of Rutherford
On a very thin gold foil, highly energetic ray of α-particles(that are positively charged with energy of 5.5MeV)was incident
Scattered α-particles when strike zinc sulphide screen(surrounding the thin gold foil) produced light flashes(scintillations) which were observed via detector(microscope)

Scattered α-particles’ distribution as a function of scattering angle(θ) was analyzed and plotted as a graph
 

As the scattering angle(θ) got higher, count of scattered α-particles observed got lower, and vice versa
Almost all of the α-particles passed through the gold foil undeflected, and infinitesimally small number of α-particles got deflected
This proved that almost all the space in an atom is empty (9999999999996%), and the positive charge is confined to an extremely small region because very few of the positively charged α-particles were repelled by gold foil proving positive charge is confined to a small region. This region was called nucleus.
Atom has a structure analogous to our solar system where nucleus (like sun) is at center and all the electrons (like planets) revolving around it in a specified circular path at large speeds

Electrons and protons are bound together by electrostatic forces of attraction and atom, as a whole is electrically neutral
Rutherford was the first to discover that atom has a nucleus and so his model was called as Rutherford’s nuclear model of atom
Electron Orbit:
Since electrons orbiting around the nucleus and are held to nucleus by electrostatic force of attraction, ergo, centripetal force (Fc) is provided by the electrostatic force (Fe) to keep electrons in the orbit.

Fc  = Fe



Here r=radius of orbit, v= velocity of orbiting electron, e= charge of an electron, m= mass of an electron, Z=atomic mass of atom, Ɛo=permittivity of free space

On solving, we get:



Kinetic Energy(K): putting the value of mv2from eq.(1), we get:


Potential Energy(U): using the electrostatic potential between 2 charged body, we get:


Negative sign here shows that there is a force of attraction and energy has to be given to the system to overcome this force of attraction
Total Energy(T):
T = U + K



Some important things to note:
Kinetic energy(K) = -(1/2)Potential energy(U)

Kinetic energy(K) = -Total energy(T)

Potential energy(U) = 2×Total energy(T)

Drawbacks of Rutherford’s Model:

Accelerated charged particle produces electromagnetic waves (Maxwell Theory), so orbital radius of electron should go on decreasing and finally electron should fall into the nucleus. But atoms are stable in nature and this stability of atoms could not be clarified by Rutherford’s model
The model didn’t talk about electronic structure of atoms, viz. electrons orientation, their orbital motion and relative energy of electron in different orbits
Dual character of electromagnetic radiation couldn’t be elaborated by the model","Property, Relation, Formula, Definition"
"ATOMIC SPECTRA:
When an electron jumps amongst energy levels in an atom, energy is emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiations and these radiations produce a spectral lines of frequencies(or wavelength) associated with an atom, called atomic spectra
Spectroscopy is the learning and examination emission and absorption spectra associated with an atom to determine its properties
Spectral lines are the bright and dark line series that constitute the spectrum associated with an atom
An atom has a discrete spectra(where exist a fixed specific lines of energy transition of electron with discrete energy gaps) also known as quantized spectra
Another type is continuous spectra(where there is no specific lines of energy transition of electrons) which is the reverse of discrete spectra
  

There are 3 types of atomic spectra: a)emission spectra, b)absorption spectra, c) continuous spectra
Emission spectra:

Radiation spectrum produced due to absorption of energy by a matter
When an electron of an atom, molecules or ions get to a higher energy state than their ground (stable) state due to radiation absorption, they are said to be excited
Emission spectrum is produced when energy is supplied to a sample (through heating or irradiation) and the wavelength or frequency of radiation emitted by the sample is observed as a function of energy
Absorption spectra:

It is just the opposite of emission spectra
Continuous radiation (energy) is directed through a sample which absorbs certain radiation of particular wavelengths and the remaining spectrum is recorded. Absorbed wavelengths correspond to the dark spaces in the spectrum
Whatever absent(showed by dark lines) in the emission spectrum of an atom is actually present (showed by bright lines) in the absorption spectrum of that atom
Continuous spectra:

Formed when a ray of white light is passed through a prism(or water droplets) causing a continuous spectrum of visible light of different wavelength
There are no discrete lines (separation) between any 2 adjacent wavelengths
Speed of light changes with respect to the medium through which it passes, so as the medium changes, light with the longest wavelength (red)deviates the least and the light with the shortest wavelength (violet) deviates the most","Definition, Property, Types"
"SPECTRAL SERIES:
On passing electric discharge through hydrogen gas, hydrogen molecules would dissociate giving rise to excited (highly energetic) hydrogen atoms that emit radiation of certain specified frequency while returning to its ground state

"TYPES OF SPECTRAL SERIES:
Balmer Series:

First scientist to discover a spectral series of hydrogen atom
It consist of visible radiation spectrum

Here R= Rhydberg constant = 109677cm-1(found experimentally), n= 3, 4, 5…… (higher discrete energy state from which electron jumps to 2nd energy state thus emitting radiation)
         λ = wavelength of emitted radiation in (cm)

For maximum wavelength(λmax) in the Balmer series, =3 (has to be minimum):
For minimum wavelength (λmin) in the Balmer series, n=∞(has to be minimum):

Spectral series when radiation emitted is due to jumping of electron from higher energy states to ground state
Mathematically expressed as


Here n= 2, 3, 4…
For maximum wavelength  in the Lyman series, n=2 (has to be minimum):
λmax = 4/3R

For minimum wavelength in the Lyman series, n=∞(has to be minimum):

"BOHR’S MODEL OF HYDROGEN ATOM:
Drawbacks of Rutherford’s atomic model lead to the Bohr’s Model where he came up with 3 postulates:
First Postulate:Atoms have some specific stable energy states(called stationary states) where electrons could orbit around the nucleus without emitting radiation
Second Postulate: Orbiting of electrons occur only in the orbits (called stable orbits) where electrons’ angular momentum(L) is equal to the integral multiples ofh/(2π), leading to the quantization of moving electron
          LN =MVNRN = NH/(2Π)

Ln= angular momentum of electron in nth orbit

Third Postulate: Electron while jumping from higher(initial) energy state to lower(final) energy state, emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the 2 energy states, and its frequency is given by:
hv = Ei - Ef
Bohr’s Radius: The radius on which electron move around the nucleus in the orbit described by the Bohr’s model is known as Bohr’s radius.

Using the second postulate and Rutherford’s model(eq.1)

mvr = nh/(2π)

Consider an element ZX
Where Z= atomic number, (the number of protons =Z and the number of electrons =Z).

"Size of Nucleus

Rutherford performed an experiment which proved that the size of the nucleus is extremely small.
In Rutherford scattering experiment a beam of alpha particles were made to pass through a small thin gold foil.
Very few alpha particles were deflected.
The alpha particles got deflected because of repulsion with the nucleus as alpha particles are positively charged.They get repelled because they are both positively charged.
Very small number of alpha particles got deflected proving that nucleus is very small in size.
It was found that the radius of a nucleus(R) of mass number A is given as :-
R=R0A1/3 where A = mass number and R0=constant.
Volume of a nucleus is ∝to the mass number.
V =(4/3)πR3 , Also R ∝(A)1/3

This relation helps in understanding nuclear masses and interaction of nuclei with each other.","Relation, Property, Formula"
"Nuclear binding energy

Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to hold an atom’s protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
Energy required holding neutrons and protons together therefore keeps the nucleus intact.
It can also be defined as the energy needed to separate the nucleons from each other.
 

Importance of nuclear binding energy describes how strongly nucleons are bound to each other. By determining its value we will come to know whether the neutrons and protons are tightly or loosely bound to each other.
If nuclear binding energy is high -> high amount of energy is needed to separate the nucleons this means nucleus is very stable.
If nuclear binding energy is low -> low amount of energy is needed to separate the nucleons this means nucleus is not very stable.
Mass defect:-
Mass defect is the difference in the mass of nucleus and its constituents(neutrons and protons).
It is denoted by ΔM.
Mathematically :- ΔM = [Z mp+ (A-Z) mn]- M
Where mp=mass of 1 proton, Z=number of protons,(A-Z)= mass of neutrons, mN = mass of 1 neutronand M =nuclearmass of the atom.
For example: -(168O)àOxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons.
Mass of 8 protons à (8x1.00866) u and Mass of 8 neutrons à(8x1.00727) u.
Therefore Oxygen nucleus à(8p+8n) à8(1.00866 + 1.00727) = 16.12744u.
From spectroscopy ->Atomic mass of (168O) =15.9949u.
Mass of 8 electrons =(8x0.00055) u.
Therefore Nuclear mass of (168O) = (15.9949 – (8x0.00055)) =15.99053u.
Nuclear mass is less than sum of the masses of its constituents.
This difference in mass is known as mass defect.
It is also known as excess mass.","Definition, Property, Relation, Examples"
"Relation between Mass defect and Nuclear binding energy:-
Nuclear binding energy is denoted by Eb.
Eb= ΔMc2
Where Eb = nuclear binding energy, ΔM=mass defect.

Nuclear binding energy is a measure of how well a nucleus is held together.","Relation, Formula, Definition, Reasoning"
"Nuclear binding energy per nucleon

Nuclear binding energy per nucleon is defined as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual constituents.
It is denoted by Ebn.
Experimentally there was a graph plotted between binding energy per nucleon and the mass number(A).
 

Following are the observations from the graph:-
Initially the graph was increasing.This implies that Ebn is very less for lesser mass number.
In the middle range the Ebn becomes constant.This means Ebn is independent of mass number.
In the end Ebn starts decreasing.This shows Ebn is less when mass number is more.","Definition, Property, Relation"
"Deriving Nuclear force from Ebn

Lighter nuclei: -
In the initial part of the graph A(mass number) is less therefore Ebn is also less.As a result lesser energy is required to separate the nucleons.
This shows nuclei are unstable.
The nuclei are unstable and in order to become stable lighter nuclei combine with each other to form heavier nuclei.
Let the energy of heavier nuclei formed is E’bn and of lighter nuclei be Ebn. This implies E’bn> Ebn.
Energy is released when 2 lighter nuclei combine together to form a heavier nuclei.
This process is known as Nuclear Fusion.
For heavier nuclei:-
Mass number is very high and Ebn is very less.
In order to become stable the heavier nuclei will split into 2 lighter nuclei.
Energy associated with heavier nuclei =Ebn and energy associated with 2 lighter nuclei =E’bn.
This implies E’bn> Ebn. Energy is released in this process by the heavier nuclei in order to attain stability.
This process is known as Nuclear Fission.
Constancy of Ebnin the mid-range of A:-
In this portion the mass number is increasing due to whichnumber of nucleons also increase.
The force which is present between the nucleons is of short range.The strength of the force decreases as the distance increases.
The nucleons are getting affected by their nearest neighbouring nucleons and not by the nucleons which are far away.
As a result Ebn remains constant.
But when there are too many nucleons Ebn suddenly starts decreasing.","Property, Relation, Definition, Effects"
"Nuclear force

The force with which the nucleons are bound together is known as nuclear force.
It is the strong attractive force that binds the nucleons together.
When the nuclear force is compared to other forces of nature like gravitational or coulomb’s force etc.it is the strongest of all the forces.
As protons are positively charged they repel each other.This force of repulsion is given by Coulomb’s force of repulsion.
This nuclear force is stronger than the coulomb’s force so it overcomes the force of repulsion.
This is the reason neutrons and protons are held together inside the nucleus.
It is independent of electric charge.Magnitude of nuclear force is same between proton-proton,proton-neutron or neutron-neutron.
Nuclear force cannot be given mathematically.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Relation"
"Radioactivity

Radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes decay to form stable nuclei.
Radioactivity was discovered accidentally by a scientist Henry Becquerel (1896).
Henry Becquerel

 

Only those nuclei which are unstable will show the phenomenon of radioactivity.
Fluorescence is a property shown by fluorescent objects; when visible light falls on a fluorescent object then these objects will also start emitting light.
Henry Becquerel performed experiments on some fluorescent objectsand he gave a hypothesis that fluorescent objects along with the visible light also emit some kind of radiation as well.
Experimental set-up:-
He took a photographic plate and placed inside a box.He placed a fluorescent object on the top of the box and allowed the sun light to fall on it.
As the box is opaque it won’t allow the rays of light to pass through it.
When the photographic plate will be developed there should be no traces of image on the plate.
He repeated the experiment by taking different compounds and observed there was no image formed on the photographic film.
This showed that sunlight is the only ray which is emitted in the above case and as the plate was covered with opaque object so the sunlight is not able to reach the plate.
 

He then took the compound of uranium known as uranium potassium sulphate.
When the photographic plate was developed there was a black spot on the photographic plate.
This shows that some radiation was emitted that reached the photographic plate.
 

In order to know from where the radiation was emitted, he kept a blade on top of a box and uranium potassium sulphate compound was placed above the blade.
After performing the experiment, when the photographic plate was developed, the photo of blade was seen on the plate.
This shows that the radiation was emitted by the uranium potassium sulphate compound.
 

Accidentally while he was performing the experiment it was not sunny that day.
The result which he got was same i.e. when the photographic plate was developed there was the same image of the blade on the plate.
Conclusion:-

The radiation was emitted by the uranium potassium sulphate compound and sunlight did not play any role in emitting the radiations.
After series of experiments he proved that it was uranium alone which was responsible for emitting the radiations.
He concluded that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own.
This phenomenon was named as radioactivity.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"Radioactive nuclides: Nuclear stability

Experimentally it was observed that the number of neutrons varies with the number of protons as we move higher in the periodic table.
For the elements which have lesser atomic number (e.g.: O, C) the number of neutrons and the number of protons are equal.
From the graph we can see the straight line shows the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons.
But as the atomic number increases gradually the number of neutrons become more than the number of protons.
In the graph there is a specific pattern like zigzag is shown bythe stable nuclides and some which don’t show this pattern represents the unstable nuclides.
The nuclides which are unstable emit some radiations to become;this phenomenon is known as radioactivity and the nuclides are known as radioactive nuclides.
Nuclides to the left of the graph arestablewhich shows they have excess neutrons.
Nuclides to the right of the graph have excess protons.Such nuclides are known as radioactive nuclides.","Property, Relation, Definition"
"Radioactive Decay

Radioactive decay is a phenomenon in which unstable nucleus decay to form stable nuclei.
There are 3 types of radioactive decay by which a unstable nuclei becomes stable nuclei:-
Alpha decay:-
In alpha decay α - particle (helium nucleus) is emitted.
Beta decay:-
In beta decay electrons or positrons are emitted.
If electronsare emitted then it is known as β- decay; and when positronsare emitted then the decay is known as β+
Gamma decay:-
In gamma decay high energy photons(γ rays) are emitted.
Law of radioactive decay:
Law of radioactive decay states that the number of nuclei undergoing decay per unit time is ∝to total number of nuclei in the sample.
Consider a sample of radioactive nuclei (Uranium). Thesample of uranium will have several uranium nuclei and they will undergo radioactive decay to convert into relatively stable lighter nuclei.
That means the number of uranium nuclei will gradually keep on decreasing with time.
For example:-
If in a sample there are 10 uranium nuclei and in another 100 uranium nuclei the rate of decay will be slower where there are 10 uranium nuclei as compared to 100 uranium nuclei.
Generalized expression for law of radioactive decay:-

Suppose there are ‘N’ active nuclei at any instant of time (‘t’).

In small interval of time ‘dt’ =’dN’ (number of nuclei decay).

Rate of decay (dN/dt) ∝N (number of nuclei which are present in the sample).

(dN/dt) = -(λ N)

Whereλ = decay constant and (-ive) sign means the number of nuclei is gradually decreasing with time.
=> (dN) =-λ dt, integrating both the sides,
=>N0N∫(dN)/N = -λ0t∫ N dt
Where N0=number of nuclei at t=0 and N= number of nuclei after time t.
[ln N]N0N = -λ[t]0t
(ln N0 – ln N) =-λt
=>ln(N/N0) = -λt
=> (N/N0)=e- λt
=>N = N0 e-λt always N0> N.
Radioactive law is also known as exponential decay law as number of nuclei decreases exponentially which can be seen from the graph if plotted between N and t.
It is followed only by radioactive nuclei.","Definition, Property, Types, Formula, Relation, Examples"
"Terminologies related to Radioactive decay

Decay Rate: -
Decay rate is defined as the number of nuclei decaying per unit time.
Denoted by ‘R’.
Mathematically:- R =-(dN/dt)
Where dN=change in the number of nuclei with time and (-ive) sign shows the number of nuclei decreasing.
From Exponential decay law N = N0 e-λt, therefore
R=(d/dt)( N0 e-λt)
=- N0 [e-λt(-λ)]
R= N0λ e-λt ;
At t=0 , R0= N0λ (equation (1))
Therefore R=R0 e-λt=>decay constant also changes exponentially.
Activity of radioactive sample:-
Activity of radioactive sample is defined as the total decay rate R of a sample of one or more radionuclides.
Decay rate of whole sample is considered.
I. unit: - Becquerel(Bq); 1Bq = (1 decay/sec).
Other unit: - Curie(Ci); 1C i=3.7 x1010
Half-life of radioactive sample:-
Half – life of radioactive sample is defined as the time at which number of nuclei reduces to one-half of their initial values.
It is denoted by t (1/2).
Half-life tells how long radioactive nuclei can last.
Mathematical expression:-
From radioactive law , N=N0e-λt (equation(1))
Initially number of sample = N0.
Later number of samples will become=(N0/2).
Therefore from equation(1)- (N0/2) =N0e-λt(1/2)
=>e-λt(1/2)= (1/2)
=>- λt(1/2) = ln(1/2) (taking log on both sides)
=>- λt(1/2) =ln(1) – ln(2)
=>λt (1/2) = ln(2) (using ln (1) =0).
=>t(1/2) = (0.693/λ)
Mean-life of radioactive sample:-
Mean life is defined as the average life of a nuclei in the radioactive sample.
Any nuclei can decay at any interval of time.
It is denoted by tav.
Mathematically:-
Let number of radioactive sample at t=0 =N0.
From the law of radioactive decay (dN/dt) =-λN
=> dN= -λNdt (these many nuclei will decay in time dt).
Therefore number of nuclei which decay between t and (t+dt) =λNdt.
But of the nuclei will decay fast and some will slowly decay.
Sum of lives of all these nuclei = tλNdt.
Therefore average life of the sample =tav= (0∞∫(tλN)dt/N0)
= (λ/N0) 0∞∫ (tN) dt.
From exponential law of decay :- N =N0 e-λt
tav= (λ/N0) ∫tN0 e-λt dt = (λ/N0)∫t e-λt dt
tav = λ0∞∫te-λtdt
=λ[t∫e-λt dt -∫(∫e-λt.1)dt
=λ[(te-λt)/(-λ)]0∞ -λ [(e-λt)/(-λ) dt]0∞
=λ[0] –λ[(e-λt)/λ2]0∞
tav = (1/ λ)
Using t(1/2) = (0.693/λ)  and tav = (1/ λ)
tav = (t(1/2)/0.693)","Definition, Formula, Relation, Property"
"Alpha decay

In alpha decay α particles are emitted.Daughter nucleus is formed from the parent nucleus.
The atomic number decreases by 2 and Mass number increases by 4.
It is a very spontaneous process and happens on its own.
It occurs only in radionuclides.
For example:-
23892U (unstable) --> 90234Th + 24He
(Uranium (U) is known as parent nucleus and Thorium (Th) is known as daughter nucleus).
24He is α particle.
General form of alpha decay: -AZX (parent) à(A-4) (Z-2) Y + 24He
Where Y is daughter nucleus.
Q-value of alpha decay

Q-value is a parameter or a characteristic of a nuclear reaction which describes whether the reaction can take place or not.
Q-value is defined as difference in the initial mass energy and final mass energy of decayed products.
Consider the general equation:-
AZX (parent) -->(A-4) (Z-2) Y + 24
Initial rest mass energy Ui =[m (AZX) - Zme]c2
Where m (AZX) = rest mass and Zme = mass of electrons.
Final rest mass energy Uf = [m((A-4) (Z-2) Y – (Z-2) me + m(24He) – 2me ] c2
Q =Ui - Uf
=[m (AZX) - Zme - m((A-4) (Z-2) Y + (Z-2) me - m(24He) + 2me]c2
Q = [m (AZX) - m((A-4) (Z-2) Y- m(24He)]c2
If Q =(+ive) then equation is energetically allowed.
=> Q>0, (Ui-Uf) >0=> Ui>Uf
This implies energy of the reactants is more than the energy of the products.
There is some free energy that is in the form of kinetic energy.
If Q =(-ive) then equation is not energetically allowed.","Definition, Property, Relation, Formula"
"Beta decay

In case of beta decay either electron or positron is emitted.
Mass number remains the same.
β−decay --> Electron is emitted.
Atomic number increases by 1.
For example:- 3215P à1632S + e- + ̅ν  where  ̅ν =anti-neutrino
Q-value for β−decay:-
AZXàA (Z+1) Y + e-+ ̅ν
Initial rest mass energy Ui = [m (AZX) - Zme]c2
Where m (AZX) = rest mass and Zme = mass of electrons
Final rest mass energy Uf = [m(A (Z+1) Y) – (Z+1) me + me ] c2
=[m(A (Z+1) Y) -Zme] c2
Therefore Q =Ui– Uf
=[m(AZX) -Zme – m(A (Z+1) Y) + Zme] c2
Q = [m(AZX) - m(A (Z+1) Y)]
Example:-

β+decay à Positron(same as electron but with (+ ive) charge) is emitted.
Atomic number decreases by 1.
For example:- 2311Na -->1022Ne + e++ν where ν = neutrino
Q-value for beta (+ive) decay:-
AZX -->A (Z-1) Y + e+ + ν
Initial rest mass energy Ui = [m (AZX) - Zme]c2
Where m (AZX) = rest mass and Zme = mass of electrons
Final rest mass energy Uf = [m(A (Z-1) Y) – (Z-1) me + me ] c2
Therefore Q =Ui - Uf
= [m (AZX) - Zme - m(A (Z-1) Y) – (Z-1)me - me] c2
Q = [m(AZX) - m(A (Z-1) Y) -2 me] c2
Example to show whether nuclear reaction can take place or not:-
11p(proton) à01n(neutron) + e+ + ν. The mass of neutron is greater than the mass of proton.
The Q-value = (-ive) as a result the above reaction is not possible.This means conversion of stable proton to neutron is not allowed.
Consider 01n (neutron) à11p (proton) + e- + ̅ν
The Q-value =(+ive) as a result above reaction is possible.This means conversion of neutron to proton is allowed.

Neutrino (ν) and anti-neutrino ( ̅ν) are neutral particles.
They also have negligible mass.
They have extremely high penetration power.
They have extremely weak interaction with matter.","Definition, Property, Relation, Formula, Examples"
"Gamma decay

In Gamma decay γ rays are emitted.γ rays are electromagnetic waves with short wavelength.
Most of the daughter nuclei of alpha decay and beta decay are in excited state.

Where (56144Ba) = Barium,(8936kr)=Krypton and (10n) =neutron.
This reaction is known as nuclear fission reaction as heavier nuclei is broken down into lighter nuclei,thereby releasing large amounts of energy.","Definition, Property"
"Types of Nuclear Fission reactions:

Uncontrolled chain reaction:-
In uncontrolled chain reaction, the reaction is uncontrolled and rapid.The reaction keeps increasing and becomes huge.
Energy of the order of mega electron volts is produced.
This reaction is known as chain reaction as the product formed in first reaction initiates the second reaction and so on.
One of the important applications of this reaction is in making atom bombs,hydrogen bombs and nuclear bombs.

"Nuclear Reactor

Nuclear reactors are useful in producing electricity.
A nuclear reactor is an arrangement to generate electricity which makes use of nuclear fission.
Requirements for controlled nuclear fission in reactor:

Neutrons to be slowed down.
Neutrons are slowed down by using moderators which are lighter nuclei which slow down fast moving neutrons by elastic collision.
Commonly used moderators:-
1.Water

Heavy Water
Graphite
Consequence of use of moderators:-
Multiplication factor of neutrons increases: - When a neutron hits a target nucleus along with daughter nucleus,it produces 3 neutrons.These 3 neutrons are highly energetic but they need to be slowed down, so they can hit the target nucleus.
As a result high multiplication factor results in uncontrolled chain reaction.
 

Excess neutrons to be absorbed.
As uncontrolled chain reaction is wanted therefore to absorb excess neutrons Control Rods are used.
These control rods are inserted in the core of the nuclear reactor.
Control rods are capable of initiating(while taking out of the reactor) and stopping(inserting in the nuclear reactor) the nuclear reaction.
As they absorb all the excess neutronsthere are no neutrons left to start the reaction.
Control rods are made up of neutron absorbing materials.
They decrease the multiplication factor of neutrons to a very small value.
Commonly used material is Cadmium.
Control Rods

 

Construction of Nuclear Reactor

The core of the nuclear reactor consists of uranium (235U) in the form of cylindrical rods.These rods are dipped inside a liquid which is the moderator.
Whenever one neutron strikes this uranium rod nuclear fission reaction starts and 3 fast moving neutrons are produced.
Because of the moderator these 3 neutrons undergo elastic collision as a result they slow down before they strike the second rod.
Geometry of the core is such that only one out of 3 neutrons which are emitted strike the next rod making the reaction a controlled one.
When the control rods are inserted inside they will absorb all the extra neutrons.Since there are no neutrons nuclear fission reaction will stop.
Large amount of energy is also released in the core.
In order to extract the energy from the core water at very high pressure is passed through it.
As hot water passes through it produces steam in the steam generators.
This steam is used to run the turbines which in turn produce electricity.
This process will keep on continuing till the uranium on the rods does not get over.Then the rods have to be replaced in the nuclear reactor.
Advantages:-

Energy released is extremely large.
Needs fuel in extremely small quantity.
Disadvantages:-

Spent fuel is highly radioactive and extremely hazardous to all life forms.

For example: From the sun we get large amount of energy and this energy generated due to the thermonuclear fusion reaction taking place in the sun.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Energy generation in sun

In sun the energy generation is a multi- step process.There are total of 4 steps involved in the energy generation inside sun.

Step2:- e+(positron) + e-(electron) -->γ(Gamma rays) + 1.02MeV
Step3:- 21H(deuteron)+ 11H(proton) -->32He(helium) + γ(Gamma rays)+5.49MeV
Step4:- 32H + 32H -->42He + 11H+11H+12.86MeV
Step 1,2,and 3 occur twice in the sun and the step 4 occurs only once.

By performing scattering experiments in which fast electrons, instead of α-particles, are projectiles that bombard targets made up of various elements, the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately measured.

It has been found that a nucleus of mass number A has a radius then, R = Ro A1/3

Where Ro = 1.2 × 10–15 m

This means the volume of the nucleus (which is proportional to R3) is proportional to A. So the density of nucleus is a constant and independent of A.","Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"

"Nuclear binding energy

The nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons so, it may be expected that the mass of the nucleus is equal to the total mass of its individual protons and neutrons. However, the nuclear mass is found to be always less than this.

For example, the nucleus of an oxygen atom (16O8) has 8 neutrons and 8 protons

So,

Mass of 8 neutrons = 8 × 1.00866 u,

Mass of 8 protons = 8 × 1.00727 u,

Mass of 8 electrons = 8 × 0.00055 u

Therefore the expected mass of 16O8 nucleus is 8 × 2.01593 u = 16.12744 u

But, the atomic mass of 16O8 found from mass spectroscopy experiments is seen to be 15.99493 u.","Property, Reasoning, Examples"

"Binding Energy

As, some mass disappears in the formation of a nucleus in the form of mass defect. This loss in mass reappears in the form of energy called binding energy.

In other words, binding energy is the energy which should be supplied to the nucleus in order to break it up into its constituent particles.","Definition, Property"
"Binding Energy per Nucleon

It is the ratio of the binding energy of a nucleus to the number of the nucleons.

"Binding Energy Curve and its Features

Binding energy per nucleon as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.

Binding energy curve is a plot of the binding energy per nucleon versus the mass number for large nuclei.",Definition
"The main features of his curve are give below:

(i) The binding energy per nucleon (Ebn) is practically constant, i.e. practically independent of the atomic number for nuclei of middle mass number ( 30 < A < 170). The curve has a maximum of about 8.75 MeV for A = 56 and has a value of 7.6 MeV for A = 238.

(ii) Binding energy per nucleon is lower for both light nuclei (A<30) and heavy nuclei (A>170).

From above two observations we can draw the conclusions given below:

(a) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding energy of a few MeV per nucleon.

(b) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged.

(c)A very heavy nucleus, say A = 240, has lower binding energy per nucleon compared to that of a nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a nucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more tightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process.

(d) Consider two very light nuclei (A ≤ 10) joining to form a heavier nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei is more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei. This means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial system. Again energy would be released in such a process of fusion. This is the energy source of the sun.","Property, Relation"
"Nuclear Force

Previously, we have studied that for average mass nuclei the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8 MeV, which is much larger than the binding energy in atoms.

Therefore, to bind a nucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally different kind.

This force is nuclear force (strongest force in nature). It is strong enough to overcome the repulsion between the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and neutrons into the tiny nuclear volume.

Some important features of the nuclear binding force are given below:

(i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force acting between charges or the gravitational forces between masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational force is much weaker than even Coulomb force.
(ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This leads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized nucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the binding energy per nucleon. A rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons as a function of distance is shown in the figure given below. The potential energy is a minimum at a distance r of about 0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger than 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less than 0.8 fm.
(iii) The nuclear force between neutron-neutron, proton-neutron and proton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not depend on the electric charge.","Property, Reasoning, Definition, Relation"

"Introduction

We know that earlier electronic devices were made up of vacuum tubes or valves



Vacuum tubes or Valves:

The evolution of vacuum tubes started with diode and proceeded to triode, tetrode and pentode
Valves control the flow of electrons; In diodes, there were two electrodes – cathode and anode
Similarly, triode had three electrodes – cathode, grid and anode; tetrode had four electrodes – anode, two grids and cathode; pentode had five electrodes –anode, three grids and cathode
Generally in vacuum tubes, the electrons are produced by heating the cathode using low tension battery; The vacuum helps in electron not losing its energy by collision with air molecules in the way
However, the vacuum tube devices had some disadvantages and they are
Bulky
Operate at high voltages
Consume more power
Have limited life
Low reliability
  Diodes and transistors

Next came the discovery of semiconductor junction, namely, junction diode and transistors
These replaced the vacuum tubes or valves


The advantages of semiconductor devices are
Small in size
Operate at low voltages
Consume small power
Long life
High reliability
Though the above advantages are present, the circuits consisting of transistors were still bulky, less shock proof
Hence, it led to the discovery of integrated circuits which is a major revolution in the electronic industry
Example – The earlier generation television and computer monitors were very bulky as they were based on the principle of vacuum tubes; now days, we have LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors which support solid state electronics","Property, Reasoning, Examples"

Inorganic semiconductors like CdS, GaAs etc

"Band theory of solids

In a substance, as many atoms are close to each other, the energy levels of the atom form a continuous band, where in the electrons move.  This is called band theory of solids.

We know that in an atom, the protons and the neutrons constitute the central part called the nucleus
The electrons revolve around the nucleus in defined orbits
The orbits are named as 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d etc. each of which has a discrete energy level
All electrons in the same orbit have the same energy
The electrons in the innermost orbits which are completely filled constitute the valence electrons whereas the electrons in the outermost orbit which do not completely fill that shell are called conduction electrons
As seen in the diagram below, both Si and Ge have 4 electrons in the outermost shell


When in the crystal, the atoms are close to each other and hence they may be flow of electrons from one atom to another in the conduction band
Let us discuss in detail by considering interatomic distance in the X-axis and energy in the Y-axis:
As seen in the diagram below, the graph is divided into 4 regions – Region A, B, C and D
In the region A, the interatomic distance is large between atoms and in region D, the interatomic distance is small
 

       Region A

Consider that the Si or Ge crystal contains N atoms. Electrons of each atom will have discrete energies in different orbits
If the atoms are isolated, that is, separated from each other by a large distance, the electron energy will be the same
However, in a crystal, the atoms are close to each other separated by a distance of 2-3 Ao. Hence, electrons interact with each other and also with the neighbouring atoms
The overlap or the interaction will be felt more by the electrons in the outermost orbit while the inner electron energies will remain unaffected
Hence, in the case of Si and Ge crystals, we need to consider the changes in energies of electron in the outer most orbit only
For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3) while for Ge, the outermost orbit is fourth orbit (n = 4)
The number of electrons in both cases is 4 – namely 2s and 2p. Hence, the outer electrons in the crystal is 4
The maximum possible number of outer electrons in the orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons)
This is the case of well separated or isolated atoms as shown in region A
Region B

Suppose the atoms start coming nearer to each other to form a solid.
The energies of the electrons in the outermost orbit may increase or decrease, due to the interaction between electrons of different atoms
The 6N states for l=1, which originally had identical energies in the isolated atoms, spread out and form an energy band as shown in the region B
Similarly, the 2N states for l = 0 split into a second band separated from the first one
Region C

At still smaller spacing, however, there comes a region in which the bands merge with each other
The lowest energy state that is a split from the upper atomic level appears to drop below the upper state that has come from the lower atomic level
In this region, no energy gap exists where the upper and the lower energy states gets mixed
Region D

If the distance between the atom further decreases, the energy bands again split apart and are separated by an energy gap Eg
The total number of available energy states 8N has been re-apportioned between the two bands (4N states each in the lower and upper energy bands)
Here there are exactly as many states in the lower band (4N) as there are available valence electrons from the atoms (4N)
This lower band called the valence band is completely filled while the upper band is completely empty. The upper band is called the conduction band","Definition, Relation, Property, Reasoning"
"Classification on the basis of energy bands

Depending upon the relative position of the valence band and the conduction band, the solids can be classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors
Conductors

The conduction band and the valence band partly overlop each other and there is no forbidden energy band gap in between
The electrons from the valence band can easily move into the conduction band
Hence, large number of electrons are available for conduction
The resistance of such materials is low and conductivity is high


Insulators

In case of insulators, a large energy gap exists between the valence band and the conduction band
The energy gap is so high that the electrons from the valence band cannot move to the conduction band by thermal excitation
As there is no electrons in the conduction band, electrical conduction is not possible


Semiconductors

A finite but a small energy gap exists between the valence band and the conduction band
At room temperature, some of the electrons from the valence band acquire energy and move into the conduction band
Hence, at high temperature, semiconductors have conductivity and resistance is also not as high as insulators


Types of semiconductors

There are two types – Intrinsic semiconductor and Extrinsic semiconductor","Types, Definition, Property"
"Intrinsic semiconductor

A pure semiconductor, free from impurities is called intrinsic semiconductor
The electrical conductivity of pure semiconductor is called intrinsic conductivity
Structure – Consider pure Germanium and Silicon. Both have 4 valence electrons
Crystalline structure

At temperature 0K –

In the crystal structure, the four valence electron of the Ge atom forms four covalent bond by sharing of electron with the neighbouring atoms
Each covalent bond is made of two atoms, each one from each atom
By forming covalent bond, each Ge atom in the crystal behaves as if the outermost orbit of each atom is complete with 8 electrons, having no free electrons in the crystal
At room temperature

The conduction is possible if the electrons break away from the covalent bonds and are free by the thermal energy
When electron breaks away from the covalent bond, the empty space or vacancy left in the bond is called a hole
An electron from the neighbouring atom can break away and can be attracted by the hole, creating hole in the other place
In the crystal structure, thus, we can see, electrons break the covalent bond and keep moving. Similarly, due to attraction of hole and electron, hole also keeps moving in a crystal
Thus, breakage of a covalent bond produces one free electron and one hole in the crystal
In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of holes = number of electrons. Thus ne = nh = ni
Energy band theory

There is an energy gap of about 1 eV between the valence and the conduction band

At temperature 0K –

In terms of energy band theory, the valence band is full and the conduction band is totally empty
As no electrons are available for conduction, the Ge crystal behaves like a electrical insulator


At room temperature -

The thermal vibrations of the atoms provide energy to the electrons in the valence band to cross the energy gap and move into the conduction band as free electrons
This results in electrical conductivity of the semiconductor
As electrons move from the valence band to the conduction band, a vacancy is created in the valence band. This vacancy is called a hole
As electrons move in the conduction band, the holes move in the valence band and electrical conduction in semiconductors is possible


At a higher temperature, when electric field is applied, the holes move towards the negative potential, giving rise to hole current and electrons move towards the positive potential giving rise to electron current. Thus I = Ie + Ih","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Formula, Relation"
"Extrinsic semiconductor

A doped semiconductor or a semiconductor with suitable impurity added to it is called extrinsic semiconductor
There are two types – n-type and p-type
In n-type semiconductor, the electrons are the majority carriers while the holes are the minority carriers
In p-type semiconductor, the holes are the majority carriers while the electrons are the minority carriers
A detailed study of n-type and p-type semiconductors, help us to understand better about the extrinsic semiconductor","Definition, Types, Property"
"n-type semiconductor

When pure Si or Ge which has four valency electrons is doped with controlled amount of pentavalent atoms, like Arsenic, Phosphorus, Antimony or Bismuth, we get a n-type semiconductor
The four valence electron from the impure atom will combine with four electrons of the Si or Ge atom to form 4 covalent bonds
The fifth electron of the impure atom is free to move. Thus, each atom of the impure substance, donates a free electron for conduction. Hence, it is called as donor atom
Giving the free electron for conduction, the impure atom becomes positively charged, giving rise to a hole
Thus in n-type semiconductors, electrons are the majority carriers and holes are minority carriers
  

Energy band theory

Comparing Si or Ge doped with impurities like Arsenic with a pure Si or Ge,  the lowest energy level  of the conduction band  is less
The electrons occupy discrete energy levels called the donor energy level between the valence band and the conduction band
This donor energy level is below the bottom of the conduction band
Thus, very small energy supplied can excite the electron from the donor level to the conduction band, hence, conductivity of semiconductor becomes remarkably improved","Property, Reasoning, Examples, Definition"
"p-type semiconductor

When pure Si or Ge which has four valency electrons is doped with controlled amount of trivalent atoms, like Gallium, Indium, Boron or Aluminium, we get a p-type semiconductor
The three valence electron from the impure atom will combine with three electrons of the Si or Ge atom to form 3 covalent bonds
There will be one unbounded electron in the Ge atom which would try to form a covalent bond with the neighbouring Ge atom
This Ge-Ge covalent bond creates a deficiency of electron in Ge atom. Thus, creating a hole
This hole is compensated by the breakage of Ge-Ge covalent bond in the neighbourhood. Hence, electron moves towards the hole, resulting in hole formation at some other place
The trivalent atoms are called acceptor atoms and conduction of electricity is due to the motion of holes
Thus in p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers


Energy band theory

Si or Ge doped with impurities like Aluminium, produces energy level which is situated in the energy gap slightly above the valence band
This is called as acceptor energy level
At room temperature, the electrons in the valence band can easily be transferred to the acceptor level. This produces a large number of holes in the valence band.
The valence band becomes the hole conducting band","Property, Reasoning, Examples, Definition"
"p-n junction formation

A p-n junction is the basic building block of many semiconductor devices like diodes, transistor etc.
 

Consider a thin p-type silicon semiconductor wafer. Convert a part of the p-type semiconductor into n-type silicon semiconductor by adding a small quantity of pentavalent impurity
The holes are the majority carriers in the p-type semiconductor and electrons are the majority carriers in the n-type semiconductor


In n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is more compared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more compared to the concentration of electrons
The first process that occurs in the p-n semiconductor is diffusion
In the formation of the p-n junction, due to the concentration gradient across the p and the n sides, the electrons diffuse from n region to p region and the holes diffuse from p region to n region


Diffusion current –
The motion of charge carriers due to the difference in concentration in two regions of the p-n junction, across the junction gives rise to diffusion current
As the diffusion continues, it leaves behind a positive charge on the n-side close to the junction. This positive charge, also called as ionised donor is immobile due to bonding with the surrounding atoms
Similarly, in the p-region, close to the junction, there is a negative charge or acceptor ions which are immobile
 

Depletion region formation –
The space charge region on both sides of the p-n junction has immobile ions and is also devoid of any charge carriers
This results in the formation of depletion region near the junction
Field setup –
The depletion region formation results in setting up a field at the junction
The field set up along the junction acts like a fictitious battery connected across the junction with positive terminal connected to the n-region


Barrier creation –
The electric field at the junction sets a barrier which opposes further diffusion of majority charge carriers through the junction
Thus, the barrier gets created at the junction prevents further diffusion
Width of the barrier – The physical distance from one side of the barrier to the other is called the width of the barrier
Height of the barrier –The difference in potential from one side of the barrier to the other side is known as the height of the barrier
Drift current
Due to the electric field developed at the junction, the electrons from the p-region move to the n-region. Similarly, the hole from the n-region move to the p-region. This results in drift current
The motion of charge carriers across the junction due to the electric field is called drift. This results in drift current
Drift current Vs Diffusion current
The drift current is in a direction opposite to that of the diffusion current
At a particular stage, the drift current becomes equal to the diffusion current
This stage is set to be equilibrium state when no current flows across the p-n junction
Potential barrier becomes maximum and is equal to VB
Thus, a p-n junction is formed. Thus, in a p-n junction under equilibrium there is no net current
The diagram below shows the p-n junction at equilibrium. . The n-material has lost some electrons and the p-material has acquired the electrons


Thus the n material is positive with respect to p material. The potential also prevents the movement of electron from the n-region to the p-region. This potential is called the barrier potential and is indicated as


When doping concentration is small, the electrons or holes move a large distance before collision with another electron or hole
Hence, the width of the p-n junction becomes large
As width of p-n junction increases, the electric field becomes small","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Relation"
"p-n junction diode

A semiconductor diode is a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage
Thus p-n junction diode is a two terminal device represented as


The equilibrium potential barrier can be altered by applying an external voltage V across the diode
There are two methods of biasing a p-n unction – Forward bias and reverse bias","Definition, Property, Types"
"Forward biasing

If the positive terminal of the external battery is connected to the p-side and the negative terminal of the external battery is connected to the n-side, then the p-n junction is said to be forward biased


The direction of the applied voltage V is in a direction opposite to that of the potential barrier setup at the junction


As a result of this, the depletion layer width decreases and the barrier height is reduced. The effective barrier height under forward bias is VB – V
If the applied voltage V is small, the barrier potential will be reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value. Hence, only small number carriers will possess energy to cross the junction. Thus, the current is small
If the applied voltage V is large, the barrier potential will be reduced significantly. Hence, the current is significant
Due to the applied voltage, the electrons from the n-side cross the depletion region and reach the p-side. Similarly, the holes from the p-side reach the n-side
As electrons reach the p-side and electrons are minority carriers in p-region, the forward bias is also known as minority carrier injection
At the junction, the minority carrier concentration increases significantly
Due to concentration gradient, the injected electrons on p-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end of the p-side
Similarly, the injected holes on the n-side diffuse from the junction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side
The motion of charged carriers on either side gives rise to current and is usually measured in mA
The total diode forward current is sum of hole diffusion current and conventional current due to electron diffusion","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
"Reverse biasing

If the positive terminal of the external battery is connected to the n-side and the negative terminal of the external battery is connected to the p-side, then the p-n junction is said to be reverse biased


The direction of the applied voltage is same as that of the barrier potential
As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to change in electric field
The effective barrier height is VB + V
This suppresses the flow of electrons from n region to p region and holes from the p region to n region. Hence, diffusion current decreases
The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on p-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This gives rise to drift current of order of few µA
The diode reverse current is not much dependent on the applied voltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers from one side of the junction to the other side of the junction
The current under reverse bias is essentially voltage independent up to a critical reverse bias voltage, known as breakdown voltage VBE
When V = VBE, the diode reverse current increases sharply. If the current is not limited, the p-n junction will get destroyed","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
"Characteristics of a p-n junction diode

There are two types of characteristics – Forward characteristics and Reverse characteristics



Forward characteristics

The graphical relationship between the forward bias voltage applied and the forward current through the p-n junction is called forward characteristics

We use a milliammeter in forward bias as the expected current is large
The current increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the voltage across the diode crosses certain value
After this voltage, the current increases exponentially, even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the threshold voltage or cut-in voltage which is 0.2V for germanium diode and 0.7 for silicon diode
Reverse characteristics

The graphical relationship between the reverse bias voltage applied and the reverse current through the p-n junction is called reverse characteristics

Rectifier is a device which is used for converting alternating current or voltage into direct current or voltage

 Input and output:



Working:

Case 1

During the positive half cycle of the input AC voltage, suppose P1 is negative and P2 is positive
On account of inductance, S1 becomes positive and S2 becomes negative
The p-n junction is forward biased and hence the resistance of the p-n junction diode becomes low
Hence, current flows in the circuit and we get output across the load resistance RL
This is indicated in the graph above
Case 2

During the negative half cycle of the input AC voltage, suppose P1 is positive and P2 is negative
On account of inductance, S1 becomes negative and S2 becomes positive
The p-n junction is reverse biased and hence the resistance of the p-n junction diode becomes high
Hence, no current flows in the circuit and we do not get any output across the load resistance RL
This is indicated in the graph above
The above process is repeated. Thus , we have current only in the positive half of the cycle. Hence, if is called as half-wave rectifier

The main difference between half and full wave rectifier in circuit, is the usage of two diodes – D1 and D2
Input and Output:



Working:

Case 1

During the positive half of the input cycle of AC voltage, the junction diode D1 is forward biased as shown in the diagram above
Hence, current flows in the above circuit as indicated
The diode D2 is reverse biased and hence no current due to D2
We get output when the same is measured across the load resistance RL due to the diode D1 alone
Case 2

During the positive half of the input cycle of AC voltage, the junction diode D2 is forward biased as shown in the diagram above
Hence, current flows in the above circuit as indicated
The diode D1 is reverse biased and hence no current due to D1
We get output when the same is measured across the load resistance RLdue to the diode D2 alone
We observe that one of the diode conducts and the flow of current across the load resistance is in the same direction
Also, current flows during both cycles of the input AC voltage. However, the output though unidirectional has ripple contents. Ripple contents indicate both AC and DC components
We can get only the DC component by passing it through a filter circuit
The filter circuit consists of Resistance and Capacitance

C has a high capacitance value and serves as a filter circuit
RL is a load resistance
Working:

The capacitance offers low impedance to AC component and offers infinite impedance to DC component
Due to this the AC component is bypassed or filtered out
The DC component produces a voltage drop across the load resistance which is almost DC voltage

"Special purpose p-n junction diode

Zener diode

It is a special purpose diode, named after the inventor C. Zener
It is designed to operate under reverse bias in the breakdown region
The symbol for Zener diode is
 

Fabrication – It has heavily doped p- side and n-side. Due to this, the depletion region formed is very thin about < 10-6. . Hence, the field at the junction is extremely high about -5 * 106 V/m for a small reverse bias voltage of 5 Volts
The high electric field strength is high enough to pull the valence electrons from the host atoms on the p-side which is accelerated to the n-side. This is known as ionisation
Characteristics – The Current – Voltage characteristics of Zener diode is shown below:
As seen from the graph, when the applied reverse bias voltage in Zener diode reaches the breakdown voltage Vz of the zener diode, there is a large change in current
The Zener voltage remains constant even though the current through the diode varies over wide range. This property of Zener diode is used for regulating the supply voltages so that they are constant
Zerner diode as a voltage regulator

                Why do we need to regulate voltage?

We know that the rectifier converts AC current into DC current.  When the AC input voltage of a rectifier fluctuates, the rectified output also fluctuates. Hence, to get a constant DC voltage from the DC unregulated output of the rectifier, we use Zener diode.

                Circuit Diagram:

The unregulated DC voltage from the output of the rectifier is connected to the Zener diode through a series resistance Rs such that the Zener diode is reverse biased
The output is measured across the load resistance RL


Working:

Case 1

When the input voltage increases, the current through Rs and Zener diode increases
This increases the voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the Zener diode
This is because in the breakdown region, the Zener voltage remains constant even though the current in the Zener diode changes
Case 2

Similarly, when the input voltage decreases, the current through Rs and hence Zener diode decreases
The voltage drop across Rs decreases without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode
Thus, the increase or decrease in the input voltage results in increase or decrease of voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the Zener diode

This way, Zener diode behaves as a voltage regulator

Precautions

The zener diode must be reverse-biased
The zener diode must have voltage greater than zener break down voltage Vz
The zener diode is to be used in a circuit where the current is less than the maximum zener current Iz limited by power rating of the given zener diode","Definition, Property, Relation, Reasoning, Effects"

Working:

It is operated under reverse bias below the breakdown voltage
When photodiode is illuminated with light (photons) , with energy hט greater than the energy gap of the semiconductor, the electron-hole pairs are generated due to the absorption of photons, in or near the depletion region of the diode
Due to electric field at the junction, electrons and holes are separated before they combine
The direction of electric field is such that the electrons reach n-side and the holes reach the p-side
The movement of electrons and holes gives rise to emf
When external load is connected, current flows. The magnitude of the photocurrent depends on the intensity of incident light
In reverse bias, we can observe that as intensity increases, the current also increases","Property, Reasoning, Relation"
"Light emitting diode



Application – They convert electrical energy into light

It is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits spontaneous radiation
The diode is encapsulated with a transparent cover so that the emitted light can come out
When the diode is forward biased, the electrons are sent from n layer to p layer and the holes are sent from p to n
Thus, at the boundary due to forward bias, the concentration of the minority carriers increases
The excess minority carriers recombine with the majority carriers, near the junction
On recombination, energy is released in the form of photons
Photons with energy equal to or slightly less than the band gap is emitted
When the forward current of the diode is small, the intensity of the light emitted is small
As the forward current increases, the intensity of light increases and reaches maximum.
Further increase in forward current, results in the decrease of light intensity
LEDs are thus biased in such a way such that the efficiency is maximum
The reverse breakdown voltage of LED is very small (say) 5V. Proper precaution should be taken such that high reverse voltage do not appear across them
LEDs have the following advantages over the conventional lamps:
Low operational voltage and less power

Principle–These photo voltaic devices convert the optical radiation into electricity


Circuit

When solar light falls on a p-n junction, it generates emf
As the solar radiation is incident at the junction, the junction area is kept much larger for more power generation
A p Si layer of about 300 * 10-6m is taken. About this a still thin layer of about 0.3 * 10-6 m n Si layer is grown on one side by the process of diffusion
The other side of the p-layer is coated with a metal. This servers as a back contact
On the top of n Si layer, metallic grid is deposited. This is called front contact
The light is incident on the grid from the top
Working

The generation of emf by the solar cell, when light falls on, is due to the following three basic processes – (a) generation (b) separation and (c) collection
Generation
The generation of electron-hole paid due to light with energy hט> Eg close to the junction
Separation
The separation of electrons and holes due to the electric field of the depletion region
The electrons are swept to the n-side and the holes to the p-side
Collection
 

The electrons reaching the n-side are collected by the front contact and holes reaching the p-side are collected by the back contact
Thus, the p-side becomes positive and the n-side becomes negative giving rise to photo voltage
When external load is connected, a photo current IL flows through the load

Circuit Diagram

Let us consider n-p-n transistor which is of common emitter configuration


Working

Using Kirchhoff’s law for the above circuit,

For the input side,

-VBB +  IBRB + VBE  = 0

In other words, VBB  =   IBRB + VBE    ----------------------------------------------(1)

Similarly, in the case of output side,

-VCC + IcRc + VCE = 0

In other words, VCE=  VCC  -  IcRc ----------------------------------------------(2)

Assume VBB as the DC input voltage Vi and VCE as output voltage Vo

Hence (1) and (2) becomes,

Vi  =   IBRB + VBE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(3)

Vo=  VCC  -  IcRc------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(4)

Let us consider the change of Vo as Vi changes from 0 to higher value

Case 1 – When Vi < 0.6 V, there is no collector current. Hence, from (4), we get

Vo=  VCC 

The transistor is said to be in cut off state

Case 2 – When 0.6V <Vi <= 1.0 V, there will be some collector current.

 Hence, from (4), we get Ic increases. Hence, as Ic term is subtracted in (4) the value of Vo output voltage decreases.

In this range, as Ic increases almost linearly, so Vo decreases linearly. The transistor is said to be in active state at this stage

Case 3 –When Vi> 1.0 V, Vo is found to decrease towards zero but not zero. The collector current Ic becomes maximum and the transistor is in saturation state.

Graph

The relationship between Vi and Vo is called transfer characteristic curve of a base biased transistor in Common emitter configuration. The above mentioned regions – Cut off region, Active region and Saturation region are marked in the graph.

In cut-off state when Vi is low, the transistor is not working and hence said to be in switched off state.  In saturation state when Vi is high, the transistor is fully conducting as Ic is nearly equal to maximum or saturated. As the transistor is fully conducting, it is said to be in switched on state.

Thus the transistor acts as a switch.

Case 2 – When AC signal voltage is applied to the input circuit

There will be a change in the emitter-base voltage and hence the emitter current

"Communication System

The general form of communication system is depicted below:



As we see here, the basic elements of communication includes transmitter, Channel and the receiver.  The transmitter and the receiver may be located geographically at different places. The Channel connects the transmitter and the receiver.
Information Source – The source produces signal of the information which needs to be communicated.

Signal – Information in electrical form suitable for transmission is called signal.

Transmitter – Converts the source signal into suitable form for transmission through the channel.

Channel – The channel connecting the transmitter and the receiver is a physical medium. The channel can be in the form of wires, cables or wireless.

Noise – When the transmitted signal propagates along the channel, it may get distorted due to channel imperfection.

Thus, noise refers to unwanted signals that tend to disturb the process of communication from the transmitter to the receiver.

Receiver – Due to noise and other factors, the corrupted version of signal arrives at the receiver. The receiver has to reconstruct the signal into recognisable form of the original message for delivering it to the user. The signal at the receiver forms the output.","Definition, Property"
"Modes of communication

Point to point communication – There is a single link between the transmitter and the receiver. Communication takes place between single transmitter and receiver

Example – Telephone



Broadcast mode – There are large number of receivers though information is sent by a single transmitter.

Example – Television and Radio","Types, Definition, Examples"
"Communication – Terminology

Transducer – Any device which converts energy in one form to another form is called transducer.

Electrical transducer: A device that converts some physical variable like pressure, displacement, force, temperature, into corresponding variations in electrical signal. Hence, the output of this would be an electrical signal.

Signal Types – Information in electrical form suitable for transmission called signal, is of two types

Analog signal –

Continuous variations of voltage and current. Hence, single valued functions of time.
Sine wave is a fundamental analog signal
Example – Sound and picture signals in television


Digital signal –

Digital step value based
Binary system where 0 represents low level and 1 represents high level is used
Universal digital coding methods like BCD – Binary Coded Decimal and ASCII – American Standard Code of Information Interchange is used in common


Amplitude –

The maximum extent of vibration or oscillation from the position of equilibrium

 



Frequency –

The frequency is the number of waves which pass a fixed place in a given amount of time.



Phase –

The two waves depicted below have a phase difference indicated by the phase shift which is the fraction of the wave cycle which has elapsed relative to the origin.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Signal propagation – Terminology

Attenuation – The loss of strength of the signal while propagating through a medium is known as attenuation.

Amplification – The process of increasing the amplitude of the signal by using an electronic circuit is called amplification. This also increases the strength of the signal. Hence, it compensates the attenuation of the signal.

Range – It is the largest distance between the source and the destination upto which the signal is received with sufficient strength.

Bandwidth – It refers to the frequency range for which the equipment operates.

Modulation – If the information signal is of low frequency, it cannot be transmitted to long distances. Hence, at transmission point, it is super imposed on high frequency wave. This high frequency wave acts as a carrier of information. This is modulation

 

Sinusoidal wave modulation:

There are 3 types of modulation, namely 1. Amplitude modulation 2.Frequency modulation and 3. Phase modulation

Amplitude modulation –

The amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the information signal


Frequency modulation –

The frequency of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the information signal


Phase modulation –

The phase of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the information signal


Pulse wave modulation:



There are 3 types of pulse wave modulation – namely (a) Pulse amplitude modulation (b) Pulse width modulation (c) Pulse position modulation

Demodulation – The process of retrieval of information from the carrier wave at the receiver is termed as demodulation. This is a reverse of modulation.

Repeater – A repeater is a combination of receiver and a transmitter.

A repeater picks up the signal from the transmitter, amplifies and retransmits it to the receiver. Thus repeaters are used to extend the range of communication system

Example – Communication satellite is a repeater station in space.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Types"
"Propagation of electromagnetic waves

While communication using radio waves, the transmitter antenna radiates electromagnetic waves. These waves travel through the space and reach the receiving antenna at the other end. We have considered below some of the wave propagation methods in brief.

Ground or Surface wave propagation:



In this mode of wave propagation, ground has a strong influence on propagation of signal waves from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. The signal wave glides over the surface of the earth
While propagating on the surface of the earth, the ground wave induces current in the ground. It also bends around the corner of the objects on the earth
Due to this, the energy of the ground wave is gradually absorbed by the earth and the power of the ground wave decreases
The power of the ground wave decreases with the increase in the distance from the transmitting station. This phenomenon of loss of power of the ground wave is called attenuation
The attenuation of ground waves increases very rapidly with the increase in its frequency
Thus, ground wave communication is not suited for high frequency signal wave and for very long range communication
To radiate signals with high efficiency, the antennas should have a size comparable to the wavelength of the signal
Sky waves:



The ionosphere plays a major role in sky wave propagation. We know that the earth’s atmosphere is divided into various regions like – Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere and Ionosphere.
The ionosphere is also called as thermosphere as temperature increases rapidly here and it is the outermost part of the earth’s atmosphere
Above troposphere, we have various layers like D (part of stratosphere), E (part of stratosphere), F1 (part of mesosphere), F2 (part of ionosphere)
The ionosphere is called so because of the presence of large number of ions or charged particles. Ionisation occurs due to the absorption of the ultraviolet and other high energy radiation coming from the sun, by the air molecues
The phenomenon of bending of electromagnetic waves in this layer so that they are diverted towards the earth is helpful in skywavepropogation. This is similar to total internal reflection in optics
The radiowaves of frequency range from 1710 kHz to 40 MHz are propagated in sky wave propagation
Space waves:



The space waves travel in straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.
Hence, space waves are used for line of sight communication such as television broadcast, microwave link and satellite communication
The line of sight communication is limited by (a) the line of sight distance (b) the curvature of the earth
At some point by the curvature of the earth, the line of sight propagation gets blocked.
The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other. It is also called range of communication dM
The range of space wave communication can be increased by increasing the heights of the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna.
The maximum line of sight distance (range of communication) dM between two transmitting anternna of height hT and the receiving antenna of height hR above the earth is given by
dM= (2RhT)1/2 + (2RhR)1/2","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Relation, Formula, Causes"
"Modulation and its necessity



Any message signal, in general, is not a single frequency sinusoidal. But it spreads over a range of frequencies called the signal bandwidth.

Suppose we wish to transmit an electronic signal, in the audio frequency range, say 20 Hz to 20kHz range, over a long distance we need to consider factors like

Size of the antenna
Effective power radiated by the antenna
Avoiding mixing of signals from different transmitters
Size of antenna:

Antenna is needed for both transmission and reception
Antenna should have a size comparable to the wavelength of the signal, atleastλ/4 where λ is the wavelength of the signal
In the above audio frequency range, if we consider frequency ט = 15,000 Hz. Then λ = c / ט = 3 * 108 / 15,000 = 20,000 m
Hence, antenna length = λ/4 = 20,000 / 4 = 5000 m.
It is practically impossible to design an antenna of height 5000m
So the transmission frequency should be raised in such a way that the length of the antenna is within 100m which is feasible for practical purpose
This shows that there is a need for converting low frequency signal to high frequency before transmission
 

Effective power radiated by the antenna:

Effective power rated by the antenna = P = E/t
Also, E = hט = hc/λ
Hence, P = E/t = hc/λ * c/λ
Studies reveal that if l is the linear length of the antenna, then P is proporational to (l/λ)2
Hence, for good transmission, high power and hence small wavelength and high frequency waves are required
High frequency waves becomes inevitable in this case also
Avoiding mixing of signals from different transmitters:

When many transmitters are transmitting baseband information signals simultaneously, they all gets mixed up
There is no way to distinguish between them
Possible solution is communication at high frequencies and allotting a band of frequencies for each transmitter so that there is no mixing
This is what is being dene for different radio and TV broadcast stations
Hence, we understand the necessity of modulation.

","Definition, Property, Relation, Formula, Reasoning"
"Band width

Bandwidth is also defined as the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time

Signals – Bandwidth:

The message signal can be voice, music, picture or computer data
Each of the above have different frequency ranges
The speech signals frequency range from 300Hz to 3100Hz. Hence, bandwidth = 3100 -300 = 2800 Hz
Any music requires bandwidth of 20kHz because of high frequencies produced by musical instruments
Video signals for transmission of picture requires 4.2 MHz of bandwidth
The Television signal which contains both voice and picture is usually allocated a bandwidth of 6MHz bandwidth for transmission
Transmission Medium – Bandwidth:

Different types of transmission media offers different bandwidth
Coaxial cables, widely used wire medium offers bandwidth of approximately 750 MHz
Communication through free space using radio waves offers wide range from hundreds of kHz to few GHz
Optical fibres are used in the frequency range of 1THz to 1000 THz (THz – Tera Hertz; 1THz = 1012Hz)
As mentioned earlier, to avoid mixing of signals, allotting a band of frequencies to a specific transmitter is in practise
The International Telecommunication Union administers this frequency allocation
Services like FM Broadcast, Television, Cellular Mobile Radio and Satellite communication operate under fixed frequency bands","Definition, Types, Property, Reasoning"
"Amplitude modulation

As we know, in amplitude modulation, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the amplitude of the information signal or modulating signal.
For sinusoidal modulating wave,
m(t) = Amsinωmt  --------------------------------(1)

Am – Amplitude of modulating signal
ωm- 2πטm – Angular frequency of modulating signal
For carrier wave,
Cm(t) = Acsinωct  --------------------------------(2)

Ac – Amplitude of carrier wave
ωm- 2πטc– Angular frequency of carrier wave
For carrier wave, the amplitude is changed by adding the amplitude of the modulating signal which is Ac plus Amsinωmt
Cm(t) = (Ac+ Amsinωmt) sin ωct  --------------------------------(3)

Multiply and Divide equation (3) RHS by Ac
Cm(t) = Ac (Ac/Ac+Am/Ac sin ωmt) sin ωct  ---------------------------(4)

Replace Am / Ac = µ

µ is called Amplitude modulation index and is always less than or equal to 1 to avoid distortion.

Cm(t) = Acsin ωct + µAc sin ωct sin ωmt   ---------------------------(5)

We know that sin A sin B = ½ [ cos (A-B) – cos (A + B)]
 

Hence, sin ωctsin ωmt = [cos (ωc-ωm)t – cos(ωc+ωm)t]

Cm(t) = Acsin ωct + µAc/2[cos (ωc-ωm)t – cos(ωc+ωm)t]

Cm(t) = Acsin ωct + µAc/2cos (ωc-ωm)t – µAc/2cos(ωc+ωm)t--------(6)

 

Equation (6) shows that the amplitude modulated signal consists of
Carrier wave of frequency ωc
Sinusoidal wave of frequency (ωc-ωm)
Sinusoidal wave of frequency (ωc+ωm)
The two additional waves are called side bands. The frequency of these bands are called side band frequencies
Frequency of lower side band = (ωc-ωm)
Frequency of upper side band = (ωc+ωm)
 

The band width of the AM wave is Frequency of lower side band minus Frequency of upper side band
(ωc+ωm) - (ωc-ωm) = 2ωm (Twice the frequency of modulating signal)

","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Production of amplitude modulated wave

We know that modulating signal is represented by
m(t) = Amsinωmt  --------------------------------(1)

Am – Amplitude of modulating signal
ωm- 2πטm – Angular frequency of modulating signal
Similarly, carrier wave is represented by
Cm(t) = Acsinωct  --------------------------------(2)

Ac – Amplitude of carrier wave
ωm- 2πטc– Angular frequency of carrier wave
 

Modulating signal is added to the carrier wave, Hence, the representation is
x(t) =Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct

The above signal is passed to a square law device (non-linear device)
y(t) =B x(t) + c [x(t)]2

            B,C – Arbitrary constants

Substitute for x(t) in y(t) and use formula (A + B)2 = A2 + B2 + 2AB
y(t) =B[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct] + c[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct]2

 =B[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct] + c[Am2sin2ωmt   + Ac 2sin 2ωct

 + 2 Am Acsin ωmtsin ωct]

We know sin A sin B = ½ [cos (A-B) – cos (A+B)]
               Hence,

                                sinωctsin ωmt = ½ [ cos (ωc – ωm)t – cos (ωc+ ωm)t ]

Also, sin2A = ( 1- cos 2A) /2
Hence,

                sin 2ωct = (1 – cos 2ωct) / 2

                sin 2ωmt = (1 – cos 2ωmt) / 2

 

Therefore y(t) can be re-written as
Y(t) =B[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct] + cAm2/ 2( 1 – cos2ωmt)

 + cAc2/ 2( 1 – cos2ωct)

+ 2 Am Ac (c/2)[ cos (ωc – ωm)t – cos (ωc+ ωm)t ] ]

Y(t) =BAmsinωmt   + BAcsinωct + c/ 2[Am 2 + Ac2]

 – cAm 2/ 2 cos2ωmt – c Ac2/ 2 cos2ωct

+ cAm Accos (ωc – ωm)t – c Am Accos (ωc+ ωm)t

In the above equation, there is a d.c. term ½ c [Am 2 + Ac2] and sinusoidal waves of frequencyωc, ωm, 2ωm,(ωc – ωm) and (ωc+ ωm)
The signal is passed through band pass filter centered atωc
This rejects the low and high frequencies. In the above case, the filter rejects d.c, ωc,ωm, 2ωm,(ωc – ωm). The frequenciesωc, (ωc – ωm) and (ωc+ ωm) are passed. This is amplitude modulated wave.
This wave cannot be passed as such. It needs to be amplified and then fed to an antenna of appropriate size for radiation.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
"Detection of amplitude modulated wave

Detection is the process of recovering the modulating signal from the modulated carrier wave.
The transmitted message gets attenuated in propagating through the channel
 
The receiving antenna receives the signal which is then amplified.


The carrier frequency is changed to a lower frequency by Intermediate frequency (IF) stage


Detection Process:

It is then passed through the detector.
Hence, INPUT – Modulated carrier wave of frequencies ωc, (ωc+ωm) and (ωc-ωm)

A force on a particle does work if the force has a component along (or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle.

In the case of motion of a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. So no work is done and no change in the magnitude of the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be changed).","Property, Reasoning"
"Generally two types of cases are possible:

Case 1st: When v is perpendicular to B

"Case 2nd: When v is making an angle with B other than 0o
