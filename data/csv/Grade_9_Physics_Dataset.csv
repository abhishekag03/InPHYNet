"Production of Sound. Sound is produced due to the vibration of objects. Vibration is the rapid to and fro motion of an object. Vibrating objects are the source of all sounds Irregular, chaotic vibrations produce noise Regular, controlled vibration can produce music All sound is a combination of pure frequencies. A stretched rubber band when plucked vibrates and produces sound.","Causes, Definition"
" Propagation of Sound
When an object vibrates, the particles around the medium vibrate. The particle in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position",Definition
"The disturbance produced by the vibrating body travels through the medium but the particles do not move forward themselves.
A wave is a disturbance which moves through a medium by the vibration of the particles of the medium. So sound is considered as a wave.Sound waves Require medium for transmission.Sound waves are called mechanical waves.",Definition
"Sound waves are called mechanical waves. When a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes and compresses the air in front of it forming a region of high pressure called compression (C). When the vibrating object moves backward, it forms a region of low pressure called rarefaction (R).","Definition, Causes"
"A vibrating object producing a series of compressions (C) and rarefaction (R)
In these waves the particles move back and forth parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. Such waves are called longitudinal waves.","Definition, Reasoning"
There is another kind of waves called transverse waves. In these waves the particles oscillate up and down perpendicular to the propagation of the direction of disturbance.,Definition
Sound propagates in a medium as a series of compressions (C) and rarefactions (R). Compressions are the regions of high pressure and density where the particles are crowded and are represented by the upper portion of the curve called crest. Rarefactions are the regions of low pressure and density where the particles are spread out and are represented by the lower portion of the curve called trough,"Causes, Definition"
Frequency of sound wave. The number of oscillations per unit time is called the frequency of the sound wave.,Definition
Amplitude of sound wave. The amplitude of sound wave is the height of the crest or trough. It is represented by the letter A. The SI unit is the same as that of density or pressure.,Definition
"Wavelength. The wavelength is the distance between the ""crests"" of two waves that are next to each other.",Definition
"Pitch and loudness of sound. The pitch of sound (shrillness or flatness) depends on the frequency of vibration. If the frequency is high, the sound has high pitch and if the frequency is low, the sound has low pitch.",Definition
"Speed of sound. The speed of sound is more in solids, less in liquids and least in gases. The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. If the temperature of the medium is more, the speed of sound is more","Definition, Property"
"Reflection of Sound. Sound gets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid and follows the laws of reflection. i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. ii) The incident ray, the reflected ray and normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.",Property
"Echo. If we shout or clap near a reflecting surface like tall building or a mountain, we hear the same sound again. This sound which we hear is called echo. It is caused due to the reflection of sound. 
To hear an echo clearly, the time interval between the original sound and the echo must be at least 0.1 s. Since the speed of sound in air is 344 m/s, the distance travelled by sound in 0.I s = 344 m/s x 0.1 s = 34.4 m 
So to hear an echo clearly, the minimum distance of the reflecting surface should be half this distance that is 17.2 m.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Reverberation. Echoes may be heard more than once due to repeated or multiple reflections of sound from several reflecting surfaces. This causes persistence of sound called reverberation. In big halls or auditoriums to reduce reverberation, the roofs and walls are covered by sound absorbing materials like compressed fibre boards, rough plaster or draperies.","Definition, Examples"
"Uses Of Multiple Reflection Of Sound .Megaphones, horns, musical instruments like trumpets, etc. are deigned to send sound by multiple reflection in a particular direction without spreading in all directions. ii) Doctors listen to sounds from the human body through a stethoscope. The sound of heartbeat reaches the doctor�s ears by multiple reflection. iii) Generally the ceilings of cinema halls and auditoriums are curved so that sound after multiple reflection reaches all parts of the hall. Sometimes a curved sound board is placed behind the stage so that sound after multiple reflection spreads evenly across the hall.","Examples, Reasoning"
Range of Hearing. Human beings can hear sound frequencies between 20 Hz and 2000 Hz. Sound whose frequency is less than 20 Hz is called infrasonic sound.Sound whose frequency is more than 2000 Hz is called ultrasonic sound.,"Property, Definiton"
"Uses of ultrasonic sound. Ultrasonic sound is used to clean objects like electronic Components, used to detect cracks in metal blocks, used in ultra sound scanners for getting images of internal organs of the human body used to break small stones formed in the kidneys into fine grains.","Examples, "
"Sonar.It is a device which uses ultrasonic waves to measure distance, direction and speed of underwater objects. The distance of the object can be calculated by knowing the speed of sound in water and the time taken between the transmission and reception of ultrasound","Definition, Property"
"Structure of the human ear. The sound waves passes through the ear canal to a thin membrane called eardrum. The eardrum vibrates. The vibrations are amplified by the three bones of the middle ear called 130 hammer, anvil and stirrup. Middle ear then transmits the sound waves to the inner ear. The brain then interprets the signals as sound.
","Causes, Reasoning"
Sound.Sound is a form of energy which produces a sensation of hearing in our ears.,Definition
Production of Sound. Sound is produced due to the vibration of objects. ,Causes
"Vibration is a periodic back-and-forth motion of the particles of an elastic body or mediumkind about a central position. It is also named as oscillation. For example: Stretched strings of a guitar vibrate to produce sound. When membrane of a table is struck, it vibrates to produce sound.","Definition, Examples"
Propagation of Sound.Sound is propagated by the to and fro motion of particles of the medium.The travelling of sound is called propagation of sound.,"Causes, Definition"
"When an object vibrates, the particles around the medium vibrate. The particle in contact with the vibrating object is first displaced from its equilibrium position. Each particle disturbs the other particle in contact. Thus, the disturbance is carried from the source to the listener.","Causes, Reasoning"
Only the disturbance produced by the vibrating body travels through the medium but the particles do not move forward themselves.,Effects
"Medium.The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium.A medium is necessary for the propagation of sound waves.The medium can be solid, liquid or gas. Sound cannot travel in vacuum. Wave that requires medium to propagate is called Mechanical wave.","Definition, Property"
"Wave.Wave is a phenomenon or disturbance in which energy is transferred from one point to another without any direct contact between them. For example: Heat, light and sound is considered as a wave.","Definition, Examples"
"Types of Waves.On the basis of direction of propagation, waves are categorized into two parts: (i) Longitudinal waves: These are the waves in which the particles of the medium vibrate along the direction of propagation of the wave. For example: sound wave. (ii) Transverse waves: In this type of wave the particles of the medium vibrate in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. For example: waves produced in a stretched string.","Types, Definition, Examples"
"Another type of waves which do not require any medium for propagation are called electromagnetic waves. These waves can travel through vacuum also. For example, light waves, X-rays.","Types, Definition, Examples"
Compression is the part of wave in which particles of the medium are closer to one another forming the region of high pressure and density. Compressions are represented by the upper portion of the curve called crest.,Definition
Rarefaction is a part of the wave where particles spread out to form a region of low pressure and density. Rarefactions are represented by the lower portion of the curve called trough.,Definition
Sound waves have following characteristics: (1) Amplitude  (2) wavelength (3) Frequency (4) Time period (5)Velocity,Property
Amplitude. The maximum displacement of each particle from its mean position is called amplitude. It is denoted by A. Its SI unit is metre (m).,Definition
Wavelength.The distance between two nearest (adjacent) crests or troughs of a wave is called its wavelength. It is denoted by the Greek letter lamda (λ). Its SI unit is metre.,Definition
Frequency.The number of vibrations per second is called frequency. The SI unit of frequency is hertz (Hz).The symbol of frequency is ν (nu).,Definition
"Time period.The time taken to complete one vibration is called time period.
It is denoted by T. Its SI unit is second (s). The frequency of a wave is the reciprocal of the time period. i.e., v = 1/T",Definition
"Velocity.The distance travelled by a wave in one second is called velocity of the wave or speed of the wave. Its S.I. unit is metres per second (m/s). Velocity = Distance travelled/Time taken ⟹      v = λ/T  , where λ = wavelength of the wave travelled in one time time period T) ⟹      v = λv      (As 1/T = v) .Thus, Velocity = Wavelength × Frequency. v = λv is called the wave equation.",Definition
"Pitch and loudness of Sound. Pitch: It represents shrillness or flatness of sound. It depends on the frequency of vibration. Higher the frequency of sound wave, the higher will be the pitch of sound and vice-versa. Loudness: It is a measure of the sound energy reaching the ear per second.It depends on the amplitude of the sound wave. It is measured in decibel ‘dB’.","Definition, Property"
Music And Noise. Music: It is the sound that is pleasant to hear. For example: Sound coming out of musical instruments). Noise: It is the sound that is unpleasant to hear. For example: Sound produced by vehicles.,"Definition, Examples"
Tone and Note.Tone: A pure sound of single frequency is called tone. Note: An impure sound produced by mixture of many frequencies is called a note. For example: A musical note has tones of various frequencies.,"Definition, Examples"
"Audible Frequency.The audible range of human ear is 20 Hz and 20,000HZ, i.e., the human ears can hear only those waves whose freqnecy lies between 20 Hz and 20,000HZ.",Definition
"Reflection of sound.When sound waves strike a surface, they return back into the same medium. This phenomenon is called reflection.",Definition
"Laws of reflection.There are two basic laws of reflection of sound: (i) Angle of incidence is equal the angle of reflection. (ii) The incident wave, the reflected wave and the normal all lie in the same plane.",Property
"Applications of  Reflection of Sound. Many instruments work on the basis of multiple reflections of sound: Megaphone, loudspeakers, bulb horns, musical instruments like trumpets, shehnais etc.  are designed to send sound by multiple reflections in a particular direction due to which the amplitude of sound waves adds up to increase loudness of sound. Stethoscope which is used by doctors to listen to the sounds from the human body, also works on principle of multiple reflections of sound. Here, sound of heartbeat reaches the doctor's ears by multiple reflections. In big halls or auditoriums sound is absorbed by walls, ceiling, seats, etc. So a curved board (sound board) is placed behind the speaker. Then the voice of speaker suffers multiple reflections to increase its loudness so that his speech  can be heard easily by audiences.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Sound is always produced by a vibrating body. Sometimes, the vibration is clearly visible and the sound is strong, whereas in some cases, the vibration is small and the sound is feeble.The to and fro or back and forth motion of a body is termed as vibration or oscillatory motion. When a tuning fork is struck hard against a rubber ball, it vibrates producing a sound. When the strings in a violin vibrates, it produces sound. When the diaphragm of a drum is struck, it vibrates and produces sound.","Causes, Definition, Examples"
"Sound can propagate through solids, liquids and gases. In fact, it needs a medium to propagate.
The matter or substance through which sound propagates is called Medium.
Sound can propagate through Solids: The doctor checks us using the stethoscope. He can hear the sound from within our body because sound travels through solids. Sound can propagate through liquids: In fact, this is how aquatic animals communicate with each other.Sound can propagate through gases/air: This is the reason why we are able to hear a person standing near us speak. Generally, air is the most common medium for sound propagation. Sound cannot propagate through vacuum. ","Property, Definition, Examples"
"Sound waves move from the point of generation to the listener through the medium.
When an object vibrates and produces sound, the particles of the medium at the point of generation begin to vibrate.
This particle passes on the vibration to its adjacent/neighboring particle. The first particle comes back to its equilibrium position of rest. Then the second particles passes its vibration to the neighboring third particle and then again comes back to its position of rest. This process continues until the vibration reaches the listener and he is able to hear the sound.","Causes, Reasoning"
"As we see, the actual particles of the medium don't travel from the point of generation to listener. It is only the vibration that travels through the medium. This is called Wave motion.
A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighboring particles into motion. Since sound waves are characterized by the motion of particles in the medium, they are Mechanical Waves.",Definition
Sound propagates in Compressions and Rarefactions.,Property
"Compression : When a vibrating body moves forward, it pushes or compresses the air ahead of it thereby creating a region of high pressure and high density. These are called Compressions. They are represented by the upper portion of the wave curve.(C)",Definition
"Rarefactions: When a vibrating body moves backward, it releases or loosens the air ahead of it thereby creating a region of low pressure and low density. These are called Rarefactions. They are represented by the lower portion of the wave curve.(R)",Definition
The peak of the wave is called Crest and valley of the wave is called Trough.,Definition
Sound waves are longitudinal waves. The individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. The particles do not move from one place to another but they simply oscillate back and forth about their position of rest thereby propagating only the disturbance from one place to another.,Property
Wavelength: The distance between 2 consecutive crest or troughs is called Wavelength. It is represented by the symbol  λ(lamda). Unit is m.,Definition
Time Period: The time taken for one complete oscillation in the density of the medium is called the Time Period of the wave. It can also be defined as the time taken by 2 consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point. It is represented by the symbol T. Its unit is in seconds.,Definition
Frequency : The number of oscillations per unit time is called the Frequency of the sound wave. The number of compressions or rarefactions that cross a given point in per unit time is the frequency of the wave. It is denoted by μ and is unit is Hz (Hertz).,Definition
A sound of a single frequency is called Tone. A sound which is a mixture of different frequencies is called Note and is very pleasant to listen to.,Definition
"Frequency   =    No of oscillations/   
                            Time (in seconds)

 μ    =   1/T",Formula
"Speed of Sound : It is the distance which a point on a wave, travels in unit time.
The speed of sound depends on the following factors.",Definition
Medium: The speed of sound decreases as we go from solid to gaseous,Definition
"Temperature : As temperature increases, the speed of sound increases. (The speed of sound in air is 331m/s at 0 degrees and 344m/s at 22 degrees)",Property
" We know that, Speed   =  Distance / Time

     We know that any point of the wave travels a distance λ in time T. So, we have

     v = λ/T  = λμ =   (Because μ = 1/ T )",Formula
Light travels faster than sound in air. Hence we see the lightning before we hear thunder.,Property
"Pitch: Frequency determines the shrillness or the pitch of the sound. Higher the frequency, higher the pitch or it is said that the sound is shrilling. Lower the frequency, lower the shrill or pitch. Eg: Babies voice has more frequency and thereby more shrilling than an adult voice.","Definition, Examples"
"Amplitude: It is a measure of the loudness or softness of the sound. The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value is called Amplitude of the wave, represented by the letter A.",Definition
"Loudness: Loudness is the response of ear to the sound. Loudness is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration body producing sound. The more the amplitude of vibration, the sound is the loud. The lesser the amplitude of vibration, the sound is feeble.Loudness  =  k.(Amplitude)2  (where k is the proportionality constant). The loudness is expressed in a unit called decibel (dB).",Definition
Intensity : The amount of sound energy passing each second through unit area is called the Intensity of Sound.,Definition
"When sound waves hit a polished or rough surface, it bounces off. This is Reflection of Sound. (Similar to Reflection of Light) Law 1 : The incident ray of sound, the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray of sound all lie in the same plane. Law 2 : Angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.",Property
"Echo. When we shout near a mountain, we will hear the same sound again and again with small time interval gaps. This is called an echo. Echoes may be heard more than once due to successive or multiple reflections.The sensation of any sound persist in our ear for about 0.1 s, which means that to hear a clear echo, the reflected sound must be atleast 0.1 seconds after the original sound.The sensation of any sound persist in our ear for about 1 s. The speed of sound in air at 22 degress is 344m/s. Therefore, Distance = Speed * Time = 344m/s * 0.1 s = 34.4m. That is the full distance ie from the source to the wall and back to the source. So, half the distance ie 2 metres is the minimum distance of the obstacle to hear a clear echo.","Definition, Examples, Property"
"Reverberation : Multiple Reflections. In a big hall, where there a musical concerts/dance shows etc, there will be repeated reflections from walls all round. The sound will persist for a very long time due to this multiple reflections. The repeated reflection that results in this persistence of sound is called reverberation. In a big hall, reverberation is required so that the entire hall can hear the sound. At the same time, if the reverberation is very high, the sound will persist for too long even if the source of sound has actually stopped. So, this is undesirable. The reverberation effect should be controlled. Several acoustic techniques are deployed to do this.","Definiton, Property, Reasoning"
"Uses of Multiple Reflection. Some musical instruments have a tube followed by a conical opening. This architecture helps to reflect sound again and again such that most of the sound waves move in the forward direction. Eg: Horn, Trumpets, Loud speakers etc.","Examples, Property"
"The walls and ceiling of concert halls are curved because of which sound after reflection reaches all corners of the hall. Also, roof and walls and seats of the auditorium are generally covered with sound-absorbent materials like compressed fireboard, rough plaster and draperies for a pronounced sound effect
",Reasoning
"Audible and Inaudible sounds. The human ear can detect sounds in the range of 20Hz-20KHz. These are called Audible Sounds. Eg: Music, Instruments, Crackers.
Frequencies below 20Hz and greater than 20KHz cannot be heard by the human ear. These are called Inaudible Sounds. Eg: It is believed that bat calls are in the inaudible ultrasonics range. Dogs can hear frequencies greater than 20KHz, so they are used by the police to respond to such whistles. Ultrasound scans produce sounds in this range.","Definition, Examples"
"Applications of Ultrasounds. Ultrasounds are high frequency waves, which can travel in defined paths even in the presence of many obstacles.",Property
"Ultrasonic waves are used to capture the images of the heart and its features and problems associated with the heart, if any (for treatment purpose). This is called echocardiography. Ultrasound scans/Ultrasonography are very commonly used to get images of internal body organs such as liver, kidney, uterus. It helps the doctor to diagnose and treat problems in the body of the patient. In this method, ultrasound waves are made to travel through the body to the organ under consideration. They get reflected and these are converted to electrical signals which can be monitored on a screen. Ultrasonography is used to observe the growth of the fetus inside the uterus. It can also used to monitor the abnormalities. It is used to break kidney stones into fine grains which later get flushed out through urine.","Examples, Definition, Reasoning"
"Ultrasound is used to clean machine parts located in places which are not easily accesible - electronic components, internal parts, spiral parts etc. The objects are placed in a cleaning solution and waves are passed through it. Because of the high frequency of the waves, the dust particles just fall out. It is used to detect defects, flaws, cracks in machine parts, bridges, building etc. Ultrasound waves are passed at one end and monitored using detectors. If there are laws or cracks, then the ultrasound waves are reflected back indicating the presence of a defect.","Exaples, Reasoning, "
"SONAR (SOund Navigation And Ranging). SONAR is a device that uses ultrasonic waves to measure distances which are practically impossible to measure - depth of ocean, distance and direction of underwater objects. SONAR comprises of a ultrasound transmitter and detector fitted in a ship.The transmitter produces ultrasound waves which travel, hit the bottom of the ocean(or any object) and return back and are detected. The time taken for the ultrasound to return (t) and speed of ultrasound in water (v) is now known. So, we have distance d = (v * t)/2 (Divided by 2, because the wave travels twice the distance, ie from transmitter to object and then object to detector)","Definition, Property, Examples"
"The Human Ear. Pinna : Pinna is the outer ear. It acts like a funnel to send the sound waves inside the ear. Auditory canal: Sound travels from the outside through auditory canal. Eardrum: The sound then falls on the eardrum which is at the end of the canal. Bones Hammer, Anvil, Stirrup : The sound vibrations are then passed on to these bones in the middle ear. Cochlea: The sound waves are converted to electrical signals. Auditory nerve: It sends the signals to the brain. Brain: The brain interprets the signals and that's how we hear.","Definition, Property"
"Sound energy is a form of energy because of which our ears are able to hear something.One cannot create sound or destroy it. But one can transform one form of energy into sound energy. For instance, when a cell phone rings, the sound is produced by converting electrical energy into sound energy.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"A sound is produced when an object vibrates, that is they move in a ‘to-and-fro’ motion. For instance, When we strike a tuning fork or a stretched rubber band, it vibrates and produces sound.The human voice is produced because of the vibration of the vocal cords. String instruments produce sound as their strings vibrate. When a bird flaps its wings a sound is produced. A flute produces sound because the air column of the flute vibrates as air passes through it.","Causes, Examples"
"In order to propagate, sound requires a medium through which it can travel. This medium could be a gas, liquid or solid. Sound propagates in a medium as the particles of the medium vibrate from a starting point. This means that sound always has a starting point and an ending point. For instance, while you talk to a friend, as you speak, the particles in the air get displaced due to the pressure caused by the sound you produce. They then displace the adjacent particles and so on. In this way, sound travels from your place to your friend’s ears.Therefore, we can say that the particles of a medium do not travel from one point one another in order to propagate sound. Sound propagates because of the disturbance caused by a source of sound in the medium.","Property, Examples"
A wave is a disturbance produced in a medium as the particles of the medium vibrate. The particles produce motion in each other without moving forward or backwards.This leads to the propagation of sound. Hence sound is often called a Wave.,"Definition, Property"
"When an object vibrates in the air or produces a sound, some regions of high pressure are created in front of it. These are called the Regions of Compression. These regions of compression move forward in the medium as particles exert pressure on their adjacent particles. WIth alternate regions of compression, there are also regions of low pressure that are in its front. Thes are called Regions of Rarefaction. As the object would move forwards and backwards consecutively producing sound, the series of compressions and rarefactions will be created. This will allow sound to move through air or any other medium as well.If the medium is dense the pressure exerted on the particles will be more in order to propagate the sound and vice versa.Therefore, we can also say that propagation of sound is all about change in the pressure of the medium.","Definition, Reasoning"
"A wave that is produced when objects of the medium oscillate is called Mechanical Wave. The sound waves are therefore, mechanical waves. Sound cannot travel through the vacuum as it always needs a medium to propagate. The vacuum contains no air hence no particles can propagate sound.

","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
Longitudinal waves - Any wave that vibrates in the direction of the motion is called a Longitudinal Wave. Sound waves are longitudinal because the particles of the medium vibrate in the direction which is parallel to the direction of the propagation of the sound waves.The particles in the medium oscillate to and fro in the case of longitudinal waves.,"Definition, Reasoning"
"Transverse Waves - A transverse wave is produced when the particles of the medium oscillate in a direction which is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the wave. The particles in a transverse wave oscillate in an up and down motion. For Example, light waves are transverse in nature.","Definition, Examples"
A sound wave is characterized by three factors:Amplitude.Frequency.Speed,Property
"The compression region is represented by the upper part of the wave curve. It is a region where particles cluster together. The density, as well as pressure, is always high in this region. ",Definition
A refraction is represented by the lower part of the wave curve. It is a region where the particles separate out. Refraction region always has lower pressure.,Definition
The distance between two consecutive compressions or refractions is called Wavelength. SI unit: metre (m) ,Definition
The number of oscillations per unit time is called the Frequency of a Wave (Number of compressions + the number of refractions per unit time) SI unit: Hertz (Hz),Definition
"The time taken between two consecutive compressions or refractions to cross a fixed point is called Time Period of the Wave. In other words, the time taken for one complete oscillation through a medium is called a Time Period. SI unit: second (s)",Definition
The relationship between frequency and time period f = 1/T,Formula
Pitch of a sound depends upon: 1. the frequency of the sound 2. size of the object producing the sound 3. type of the object producing the sound,Property
The value of the maximum or minimum disturbance caused in the medium is called the Amplitude of the Sound. Amplitude defines if the sound is loud or soft.,"Definition, Property"
The timbre or quality of sound is a characteristic with which we can differentiate between different sounds even if they have same pitch and amplitude.,Definition
The sound which has single frequency throughout is called a Tone.,Definition
A sound with more than one frequency is called a Note. It is pleasant to listen,Definition
Noise. It is an unpleasant sound.,Definition
Music. It is a sound which is pleasant and has rich quality,Definition
The distance by which a compression or refraction of a wave travels per unit time is called as Sound’s Speed. SI unit: metres/seconds.v = wavelength / time = λ/T = λ*F. Speed of Sound in air = 333 m/s,"Definition, Formula"
Intensity. The amount of sound energy that passes through a unit area per second is called its intensity,Definition
Loudness. It is how our ears respond to a sound. Two sounds with same intensity can vary in loudness only because we can detect one sound easier than the other. ,Definition
"Sound cannot travel at the same speed in different mediums. The speed of sound in a medium is affected by three things: The density of the medium. For instance, speed of sound is the maximum through solids. The temperature of the medium. As the temperature increases, the sound propagates easily. Humidity in the air also affects the travel of sound. As the humidity increases, so does the propagation of sound.",Property
"When an object travels in the air with a speed greater than that of the sound, it produces a sound with high energy. This energy is loud enough that it can break glasses or damage the buildings. The sound produced is similar to the sound of an explosion or thunderclap. These objects exert a large amount of pressure on the air which causes the production of shock waves in the air. These shock waves produce extremely large and loud sound waves which are called Sonic booms.","Causes, Definition"
"Speed of light in air = 3 * 108 m/s. Speed of sound in air = 333 m/s. This clearly states that sound travels a lower speed than that of light in air. This is a reason why at the time of lightening, the light is visible instantly while the sound of the thunder reaches our ears after a few seconds. Sound can bounce off a solid or a liquid. Some materials like metals and walls are called Good Reflectors of Sound as they do not absorb the sound while others like clothes and sponge are called Bad Reflectors of Sound as they absorb the sound easily.","Property, Reasoning"
"The incident sound wave, the reflected sound wave and the normal, all lie in the same plane.The angle of incident of incident sound wave is equal to the angle of reflection formed by the reflected sound wave, that is, i = r","Property, Formula"
Echo. When we hear the same sound again and again in a medium it is called Echo. The sound or echo persists in our brain for 0.1 seconds. This means that the difference between sound and its echo should be at least 0.1 seconds. It is produced as a result of reflection of sound through a medium. If sound reflects more than once we may hear multiple echoes.,"Definition, Property"
Reverberation. It is the persistence of a sound after a sound is produced. A reverberation is created when a sound signal is reflected multiple of times until it reaches a sound wave that cannot be heard by human ears. Auditoriums and big halls often have to deal with reverberation. That is why the roofs are made up of soundproof materials like Flipboard and the chairs in the halls are also made up of fabrics that can absorb sound.,"Definition, Examples, Reasoning"
"Horns, trumpets, loudhailers or megaphones are designed in such a way that sound can travel in a particular direction only without spreading out everywhere. This makes it easier for the audience to listen to the speaker. All these instruments work on the phenomena of multiple reflections of sound.","Reasoning, Examples"
The multiple reflections in a stethoscope tube make it possible for the doctors to listen to a patient’s heartbeat.,"Examples, Reasoning"
Concert halls are generally covered so that sound can reflect through it and reach the wider audience.,"Reasoning, Examples"
"The range of sound – on the basis of the range of frequency of a sound, it is categorized into ultrasound and infrasound. Human auditory range is between 20 Hz and 20000 Hz.",Definition
"Infrasound refers to the sound with frequency lower than 20 Hz which can’t be heard by humans.Infrasound is used to stabilize myopia in young kids.Infrasound is influenced by the atmosphere so it can be used to monitor the activities of the atmosphere.In particular, natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes etc can be forecasted by monitoring the infrasonic waves.","Definition, Reasoning, Examples"
"Ultrasound refers to the sound with frequency higher than the upper limit (20 kHz) of frequencies audible to normal human ears. Ultrasound is commonly used to find flaws in materials to measure the thickness of objects, to fund physical abnormalities in various parts of human body, as well as in the form of a sound ranging device called Sonar. Ultrasound is not influenced by any such factors. In particular, ultrasound is also used in micro welding. The weld is produced by the application of higher frequency vibratory energy as the parts are held together with force. ","Definition, Property, Examples, Reasoning"
Hearing Aid- The Hearing Aid contains a microphone which receives the sound from the outer atmosphere and converts it into electrical energy. This electrical energy is passed through an amplifier which amplifies the sound and then moves it to a speaker. The speaker then converts the electrical signal into sound waves and sends it to the ear and provides a clear hearing.,Definition
"The ultrasound waves are the sound waves with high frequency. Due to this, they can travel long distances despite any obstacles between their paths. The ultrasound waves are used in clearing parts of objects that are hard to reach such as a spiral tube or electronic components. In order to clean the objects, they are put in a solution, then the ultrasonic waves are passed through the solution. As a result, the dust particles on the object get detached and fall off them. Ultrasound waves can recognize tiny cracks in metallic objects that are used in the manufacture of large structures, buildings and scientific equipment. The presence of such cracks can lower the strength of these structures and machines. Hence, the ultrasound waves are passed through the metallic objects and detectors are used to detect the waves that pass through the cracks. If a crack is present the ultrasound waves would reflect back. Ultrasonic waves are also used in a medical process called Echocardiography. In this process, the ultrasound waves are passed through various parts of the heart in order to form the images of the organ. Ultrasonic waves are also used in a procedure called Ultrasonography. In this procedure, the ultrasonic waves are passed through the internal organs of the body in order to get their image. In this way, the doctors can find out the cause of a disease or any abnormalities in the organs.

Galileo’s Observation - He observed the motion of objects on an inclined plane. When a marble is rolled down an inclined plane its velocity increases.,Definition 
Galileo’s Arguments - When a marble is rolled down from the left – It will go up on the opposite side up to the same height at which it is dropped down. If the inclination of planes is equal – The marble would travel equal distances while climbing up as travelled while rolling down. If we decrease the angle of inclination of the right plane – The marble would travel further until it reaches its original height. If the right side plane is made flat – Marble would travel forever to achieve the same height. ,"Definition, Example, "
"Galileo's Inference We need an unbalanced force to change the motion of the marble but no force is required when the marble is moving uniformly. In other words, objects move at a constant speed if no force acts upon them.","Definition, Reasoning"
Based on Galileo’s ideas Newton presented the three Laws of Motion,Definiton
"First law of motion or The Law of Inertia Whether an object is moving uniformly on a straight path or is at rest, its state would not change until and unless an external force is applied on to it.",Definiton
"Hence, we can say that objects oppose a change in their state of motion or rest. This tendency of objects to remain in the state of rest or to keep moving uniformly is called Inertia.",Definition 
Examples of Inertia. We fall back when a vehicle starts moving in the forward direction because our body is in the rest state and it opposes the motion of the vehicle. We fall forward when brakes are applied in a car because our body opposite the change of state of motion to rest,"Examples, Reasoning "
"Inertia and Mass.The inertia of an object is dependent upon its mass.Lighter objects have less inertia, that is, they can easily change their state of rest or motion.Heavier objects have large inertia and therefore they show more resistance.Hence ‘Mass’ is called a measure of the inertia of an object.","Reasoning, Definition"
 it is easier for a person to push the bucket that is empty rather than the one that is filled with sand. This is because the mass of an empty bucket is less than that of the bucket filled with sand.,Reasoning
"The impact produced by a moving object depends upon its mass and velocity.For Example, a small bullet fired at a high velocity can kill a person.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Momentum – The product of mass and velocity is called Momentum. It is a vector quantity. Its direction is same as that of the object’s velocity. Denoted by – p. SI unit – kg metre per second. p = mv, where m is the mass of the object, v is the velocity of the object.","Definition, Formula"
"The momentum of a stationary object – Let the mass of a stationary object be ‘m’, Let the velocity of a stationary object be ‘v’, The stationary object has no velocity, so v = 0, Therefore, p = m*v = m*0 = 0. So, the momentum of a stationary object is zero.","Formula, Reasoning"
"We know that the velocity of an object can be changed by applying an unbalanced force on to it. Similarly, the momentum of an object can change by applying an unbalanced force.",Reasoning 
According to the second law of motion – The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the applied unbalanced force on the object in the direction of the force.,Definition
For Example – A cricketer when catches a ball pulls his hands in the backward direction to give some time to decrease the velocity of the ball. As the acceleration of the ball decreases the force exerted on catching the moving ball also decreases. If the cricketer would try to stop a moving ball suddenly he would have to apply larger force.,Examples
with help of the second law of motion we can evaluate the amount of force that is being exerted on any object. ,Reasoning
force is directly proportional to acceleration. So the acceleration of an object can change depending upon the change in force applied.,"Effects, Reasoning"
"Action and Reaction Forces. Two forces acting from opposite directions are called Action and Reaction Forces. For Example, a ball when hits the ground (action) bounces back with a certain force reaction.",Definition
"The Third Law of Motion States that – When an object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantly exerts a force back onto the first object. These forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on two different objects always",Definition 
every action has an equal and opposite reaction.,Definition 
The magnitudes of forces acting upon the objects are same but the acceleration produced in them may or may not be the same because the objects can differ in masses.,Property
"For Example, when a bullet is fired from a gun, the gun only moves a little backwards (recoils) while the bullet can travel a large distance. This is because of the difference in the mass of the bullet and the gun.","Example, Reasoning"
"Conservation of Momentum As per the law of conservation of momentum, the sum of momenta of two objects before the collision and after collision remains the same given that no external unbalanced force acts upon them. In another way, collision conserves the total momentum of two objects.",Definition
"Force. It is the force that enables us to do any work. To do anything, either we pull or push the object. Therefore, pull or push is called force.",Definition 
"Example: to open a door, either we push or pull it. A drawer is pulled to open and pushed to close.",Examples
"Force can make a stationary body in motion. For example a football can be set to move by kicking it, i.e. by applying a force.","Effects, Examples"
"Force can stop a moving body: For example by applying brakes, a running cycle or a running vehicle can be stopped.","Effects, Examples"
"Force can change the direction of a moving object. For example; By applying force, i.e. by moving handle the direction of a running bicycle can be changed. Similarly by moving steering the direction of a running vehicle is changed.","Effects, Examples"

"Force can change the shape and size of an object. For example: By hammering, a block of metal can be turned into a thin sheet. By hammering a stone can be broken into pieces.","Effects, Examples"
"Balanced Forces. If the resultant of applied forces is equal to zero, it is called balanced forces.",Definition 
"Example: In the tug of war if both the teams apply similar magnitude of forces in oppoisite directions, rope does not move in either side. This happens becasue of balanced forces in which resultant of applied forces become zero.","Examples, Reasoning"
Balanced forces do not cause any change of state of an object. Balanced forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.,Effects 
"Balanced forces can change the shape and size of an object. For example - When forces are applied from both sides over a balloon, the size and shape of balloon is changed.","Effects, Examples"
Unbalanced Forces.If the resultant of applied forces are greater than zero the forces are called unbalanced forces. An object in rest can be moved because of applying balanced forces.,Definition 
Unbalanced forces can do the following: Move a stationary object. Increase the speed of a moving object. Decrease the speed of a moving object. Stop a moving object. Change the shape and size of an object.,Effects
"Galileo Galilei: Galileo first of all said that object move with a constant speed when no forces act on them. This means if an object is moving on a frictionless path and no other force is acting upon it, the object would be moving forever. That is there is no unbalanced force working on the object.",Reasoning
"But practically it is not possible for any object. Because to attain the condition of zero unbalanced force is impossible. Force of friction, force air and many other forces always acting upon an object.",Reasoning
Newton studied the ideas of Galileo and gave the three laws of motion. These laws are known as Newton’s Laws of Motion.,Definition

Newton's Third Law of Motion: There is an equal and opposite reaction for every action.,Definition 
"Newton’s First Law of Motion: Explanation: If any object is in the state of rest, then it will remain in rest untill a exernal force is applied to change its state. Similarly an object will remain in motion untill any exeternal force is applied over it to change its state. This means all objects resist to in changing their state. The state of any object can be changed by applying external forces only.",Reasoning
"A person standing in a bus falls backward when bus is start moving suddenly. This happens because the person and bus both are in rest while bus is not moving, but as the bus starts moving the legs of the person start moving along with bus but rest portion of his body has tendency to remain in rest. Because of this person falls backward; if he is not alert.","Reasoning, Examples"
"A person standing in a moving bus falls forward if driver applies brakes suddenly. This happens because when bus is moving, the person standing in it is also in motion along with bus. But when driver applies brakes the speed of bus decreases suddenly or bus comes in the state of rest suddenly, in this condition the legs of the person which are in the contact with bus come in rest while the rest parts of his body have tendency to remain in motion. Because of this person falls forward if he is not alert.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Before hanging the wet clothes over laundry line, usually many jerks are given to the cloths to get them dried quickly. Because of jerks droplets of water from the pores of the cloth falls on the ground and reduced amount of water in clothes dried them quickly.

"When the pile of coin on the carom-board hit by a striker; coin only at the bottom moves away leaving rest of the pile of coin at same place.

"Seat belts are used in car and other vehicles, to prevent the passengers being thrown in the condition of sudden braking or other emergency. In the condition of sudden braking of the vehicles or any other emergency such as accident, the speed of vehicle would decrease or vehicle may stop suddenly, in that condition passengers may be thrown in the direction of the motion of vehicle because of the tendency to remain in the state of motion.","Reasoning, Examples"
"The head of hammer is tightened on a wooden handle by banging the handle against a hard surface. When handle of the hammer is struck against a surface, handle comes in rest while hammer over it's head has tendency to remain in motion and thus after some jerks it tightens over the handle.","Reasoning, Examples"
Mass and Inertia:The property of an object because of which it resists to get disturbed its state is called Inertia. Inertia of an object is measured by its mass. Inertia is directly proportional to the mass. This means inertia increases with increase in mass and decreases with decrease in mass. A heavy object will have more inertia than lighter one.,"Definition, Reasoning"
"In other words, the natural tendecny of an object that resists the change in state of motion or rest of the boject is called intertia.",Definition 
"Since a heavy object has more intertia, thus it is difficult to push or pull a heavy box over the ground than lighter one.",Reasoning
"MOMENTUM Momentum is the power of motion of an object. The product of velocity and mass is called the momentum. Momentum is denoted by ‘p’. Therefore, momentum of the object = Mass x Velocity. Or, p = m x v Where, p = momentum, m = mass of the object and v = velocity of the object.",Definition
"A person gets injured in the case of getting hit by a moving object, such as stone, pebbles or anything because of momentum of the object.","Reasoning, Examples"
Even a small bullet is able to kill a person when it is fired from a gun becasue of its momentum due to great velocity.,"Reasoning, Examples"
"A person gets injured severely when hit by a moving vehicles, becasue of momentum of vehicle due to mass and velocity.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Since, momentum is the product of mass and velocity (p = m x v) of an object. This means momentum is directly proportional to mass and velocity.Momentum increases with increase of either mass or velocity of an object.","Formula, Reasoning, Definition "
"This means if a lighter and a heavier object is moving with same velocity, then heavier object will have more momentum than lighter one.",Reasoning
"If a small object is moving with great velocity, it has tremendous momentum. And because of momentum, it can harm an object more severely. For example a small bullet having a little mass even kills a person when it is fired from a gun.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Usually, road accidents prove more fatal because of high speed than at slower speed. This happens because vehicles running with high speed have greater momentum compare to a vehicle running with slower speed.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Let an object with mass 'm' is in the rest. Since, object is in rest, therefore, it's velocity, v = 0. Now, we know that, Momentum = mass x velocity .Or, p = m x 0 = 0.Thus, the momentum of an object in the rest, i.e. non-moving,is equal to zero.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Unit of momentum: The SI unit of mass = kg.The SI unit of velocity = meter per second i.e. m/s. We know that, momentum (p) = m x v.Therefore, p = kg x m/s. Or, p = kg m/s.Therefore, SI unit of momentum = kg m/s",Formula

"If all the planets in the Solar System are moving at the same speed, then which planet is going to have the greatest momentum? Why?",Examples
Newton's second Law of Motion states that The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the force applied in the direction of force.,Examples
"For example; when acceleration is applied on a moving vehicle, the momentum of the vehicle increases and the increase is in the direction of motion because the force is being applied in the direction of motion. On the other hand, when brake is applied on the moving vehicle, the momentum of the vehicle decreases and the decrease is in the opposite direction of motion because the force is being applied in the opposite direction of motion.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Let mass of an moving object = m. Let the velocity of the object changes from 
'u'; to 'v' in the interval of time 't'.This means, Initial velocity of the object = u. Final velocity of the object = v. We know that momentum (p) = Mass x velocityTherefore, Momentum (p) of the object at its initial velocity u = m × u = mu Momentum (p) of the object at its final velocity v = m × v = mv .The change in momentum = mv −mu Rate of change of momentum = mv − mu t -----(i",Formula
"According to the Newton’s Second Law of motion force is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum.This means, Force ∝ Rate of change of moentumAfter substituting the value of rate of change of momentum from equation (i) we get.Force (F)  ∝ mv − mu t⇒ F ∝ m(v − u) t ⇒ F ∝ mv − u t ⇒ F ∝ ma [∵ acceleration (a) = v − u t] [Since, acceleration is the rate of change in velocity] ⇒ F = k⋅m⋅a ----(ii) Where k is the proportionality constant ∵ 1 unit force is defined as the mass of 1kg object produces the acceleration of 1m/s2 ∴ 1 unit of force = k × 1 kg × 1m /s 2 ∴ by putting the value of  k =1 in equation (ii) F = m⋅a ----(iii)⇒ Force = mass x acceleration.Thus Newton’s Second Law of Motion gives the relation between force, mass and acceleration of an object.According to the relation obtained above, Newton’s Second Law can be modified as follows:The product of mass and acceleration is the force acting on the object.",Formula
"The SI unit of Force: Newton (N). Since Force = Mass x AccelerationThe unit of mass = kg and The unit of acceleration = m/s2If force, mass and acceleration is taken as 1 unit.Therefore,1 Newton (N) = 1kg x 1m/s2. Thus, Newton (N) = kg m/s2 Equation (v) can be also written as ⇒ a = F m This equation is the form of Newton’s Second Law of Motion. According to this equation, Newton’s Second Law of Motion can also be stated as follow:The acceleration produced by a moving body is directly proportional to the force applied over it and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.",Formula
Acceleration increases with increase in force and vice versa.Acceleration decreases with increase in mass and vice versa.That’s why a small vehicle requires less force to attain more acceleration while a heavy vehicle requires more force to get the same acceleration.,Reasoning
" A fielder pulls his hand backward; while catching a cricket ball coming with a great speed, to reduce the momentum of the ball with a little delay. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion; rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the force applied in the direction.While catching a cricket ball the momentum of ball is reduced to zero when it is stopped after coming in the hands of fielder. If the ball is stopped suddenly, its momentum will be reduced to zero instantly. The rate of change in momentum is very quick and as a result, the player’s hand may get injured. Therefore, by pulling the hand backward a fielder gives more time to the change of momentum to become zero. This prevents the hands of fielder from getting hurt.","Reasoning, Examples"
"For athletes of long and high jump sand bed or cushioned bed is provided to allow a delayed change of momentum to zero because of jumping of athlete.When an athlete falls on the ground after performing a high or long jump, the momentum because of the velocity and mass of the athlete is reduced to zero. If the momentum of an athlete will be reduced to zero instantly, the force because of momentum may hurt the player. By providing a cushioned bed, the reduction of the momentum of the athlete to zero is delayed. This prevents the athlete from getting hurt.(c) Seat belts in car - Seat belts in the vehicles prevent the passenger from getting thrown in the direction of motion. In case of emergency, such as accidents or sudden braking, passengers may be thrown in the direction of motion of vehicle and may get fatal injuries. The stretchable seat belts increase the time of the rate of momentum to be reduced to zero. The delayed reduction of momentum to zero prevents passengers from such fatal injury.","Reasoning, Examples"

"Walking of a person - A person is able to walk because of the Newton’s Third Law of Motion. During walking, a person pushes the ground in backward direction and in the reaction the ground also pushes the person with equal magnitude of force but in opposite direction. This enables him to move in forward direction against the push.","Reasoning, Examples"

"We know that, Momentum = Mass x VelocityTherefore, Momentum of  A ( FA) before collision  =m1 ×u1 Momentum of B (FB) before collision = m2 × u2 Momentum of A after collision = m1 × v1 Momentum of B after collision = m2 × v2 Now, we know that Rate of change of momentum = Mass x rate of change in velocity = mass x Change in velocity/time Therefore, rate of change of momentum of A during collision, FAB= m1(v1−u1t) Similarly the rate of change of momentum of B during collision, FBA = m2(v2 − u2t)",Formula
"Since, according to the Newton's Third Law of Motion, action of the object A (force exerted by A) will be equal to reaction of the object B(force exerted by B). But the force exerted in the course of action and reaction is in opposite direction.","Formula, Reasoning"
"Therefore, F AB= − FBA ⇒ m1(v1− u1t) = − m2(v2− u2t) ⇒ m1(v1−u1)= − m2(v2 − u2) ⇒ m1v1 − m1u1 = −m2v2+ m2u2 ⇒ m1v1+ m2v2= m1u1+ m2u2 ⇒ m1u1+ m2u2 = m1v1+ m2v2---(i)",Formula
"Above equation says that total momentum of object A and B before collision is equal to the total momentum of object A and B after collision. This means there is no loss of momentum, i.e. momentum is conserved. This situation is considered assuming there is no external force acting upon the object.This is the Law of Conservation of Momentum, which states that in a closed system the total momentum is constant.In the condition of collision, the velocity of the object which is moving faster is decreased and the velocity of the object which is moving slower is increased after collision. The magnitude of loss of momentum of faster object is equal to the magnitude of gain of momentum by slower object after collision.",Definition
"Bullet and Gun – When bullet is fired from a gun, gun recoils in the opposite direction of bullet. The momentum of bullet is equal to momentum of gun.

In a head to head car accident the momentum is transferred from one car to the other, but so much force is applied that the car structure cannot handle it, this is why a car wrecks. If the cars were able to deal with the amount of force, and the collision was elastic they both will move in opposite directions, considering their weights are same.",Reasoning 
"In short momentum is always conserved in any collision, whether it be an elastic or a non-elastic collision, though kinetic energy is not conserved in a non-elastic collision, the kinetic energy is converted into heat energy or potential energy etc.",Reasoning 
"Consider this example of a balloon, the particles of gas move rapidly colliding with each other and the walls of the balloon, even though the particles themselves move faster and slower when they loose or gain momentum when they collide, the total momentum of the system remains the same. Hence, the balloon doesn’t change in size, if we add external energy by heating it, the balloon should expand because it increases the velocity of the particles and this increases their momentum in turn increasing the force exerted by them on the walls of the balloon.","Examples, Reasoning "
"Having said so the energy of a system is always conserved, one of the best applications of the law of conservation of momentum would be in space travel, there is no medium in space to exert a force on, then how do rockets travel? Well, they eject matter at very high speed so in an isolated system the momentum should remain constant therefore the rocket will move in the opposite direction with the same momentum as that of the exhaust.","Reasoning, Examples"
