Moving air is called Wind.,Definition,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Since air is a mixture of gases, wind is the flow of gases on a large scale.
Winds are caused by heating difference between different parts of the world and the movement of the earth.
Winds can be of classified on the basis of:
Duration: Long and Short
Strength: High, medium and low
Speed: Slow and Fast
High strength winds for longer duration, like cyclone or hurricanes, may cause hazardous effects.","Definition, Types, Property, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Applications of wind include Windmills (to generate electricity), fan, flying kite, Hair Dryer etc.",Examples,Grade_7_Physics_Data
Atmospheric pressureis the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere of Earth (or that of another planet).,Definition,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"All gases in the atmosphere exert pressure on each other, the earth and the objects on earth including humans.
The pressure exerted on a human body by atmosphere is compensated by the pressure exerted by the gases inside human body.
The force or the pressure exerted by air/wind makes loose paper, hair, flags, leaves of trees
Manual tasks like riding bicycle or rowing boat against the wind requires more muscular energy, than normal, due to the opposing pressure exerted by wind.Similarly, If riding and rowing are being done in the direction of wind, then these tasks require less muscular energy than normal.","Effects, Reasoning, Examples",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Distortion of tin can or bottle
Closed Tin can half filled with boiling water.
The can will have hot water as well as steam.
Now, pouring cold water will make the steam condense and become water.
This reduces air inside the can.
Since the pressure of air inside can becomes lower than air outside, the can’s shape will become distorted.","Reasoning, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Sucking a straw decreases pressure inside it, this makes the outside atmospheric pressure become higher and the fluid thus goes up through the straw.
Tyre tube bursts when over filled with air due to the fact that the pressure inside the tube becomes higher than the outer atmospheric pressure","Effects, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"As the pressure of an area reduces, wind speed increases and vice versa. Higher the pressure difference, higher the speed of wind.","Reasoning, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Thus, the two major concepts are:

High speed winds are accompanied by reduced air pressure.
Air travels from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.",Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Air molecules expand on heating and contract on cooling.
Hot air molecules take more space than cold air molecules.
Warm or Hot air is lighter than cool air.
Warm air, like smoke, rises up and cool air settles down.
When warm air rises up, it creates low pressure in the area, so surrounding cooler air, from relatively higher pressure, then comes to take up its place.",Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"When a test tube is immersed in hot water, the air inside it expands and tries to take more space. On the other hand, when immersed in cold water, the air inside the tube contracts a little and tries to take up lesser space than normal.",Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Winds or wind currents are generated by two factors:

Uneven heating between Poles and Equator",Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Centre of the earth is called Equator and the two extreme positions are Poles.
Poles are cooler than equator as highest intensity of the sun’s heat and light falls on the equator and it reduces as we go either side of equator towards the poles.
Cooler air from surrounding areas of the equator comes towards the equator to fill the place of warm air which rises up due to sun’s heating.
Similarly, cooler air from poles comes towards the surrounding areas as the surrounding areas have air warmer than the poles.
These winds from north to equator and south to equator are not straight as their direction change due to earth’s rotation on its axis.","Reasoning, Causes, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Summer and Winter Winds
During summer season, winds blow from sea towards land on a large scale.
These winds carry water droplets with them and form clouds.
During monsoon season, these clouds rain as they become heavier.
Rain is useful for farmers for irrigation but excessive rain causes floods and diseases.
During winter season, the winds blow from land to sea and they do not carry any water droplets with them. Hence, Monsoon season occurs only after summer season.","Reasoning, Causes, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
A storm is a disturbed state of environment creating severe weather conditions mainly high speed winds. A thunderstorm is a storm with sound and lightning and typically also heavy rain or hail.,Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Thunderstorms develop in hot and humid areas.
High temperature in this areas cause hot humid (with water vapours) air to rise up. So, strong upward rising winds with water droplets are generated.
At high altitude, these water drops freeze and fall again towards earth.
Upward movement of air and downward movement of water drops, together, cause lightning and sound.","Reasoning, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
A Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around strong centers of low pressure,Definition,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Water vapors are formed when water is heated.
This heat is released to atmosphere when water vapors convert to water during rains.
The heat released, warms the air around and makes it to move up. This also results in decreased air pressure.
Hence, cooler air from surrounding rushes to take the warm air’s place.
This repeats till a low pressure system with surrounding high speed winds is created. This is called a Cyclone.
Cyclone depends on wind speed, direction, temperature and humidity.
Cyclones are also called Hurricane in USA and Typhoon in Japan and Philippines","Causes, Examples, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"East coastline of India (Mainly Orissa) is prone to Cyclones being a coastal area.
Cyclone hit areas result in loss of life, property, communication and transportation systems.
Cyclones cause a wall of water to move from sea towards shores resulting in destruction.
Cyclones also bring heavy rainfalls which could lead to flood situations.
Damages agricultural land and reduces soil fertility.",Effects,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"A tornadois a violently rotating dark funnel shaped cloud that reached from sky towards ground.

Diameter of a tornado ranges from few meters to a km.
It grows bigger by taking dust and anything else near it. Smaller tornadoes can only make dust rotate with itself whereas a bigger tornado can take vehicles or even houses.
It sucks everything from bottom and throws them out from the top.
Tornadoes can attain a speed of 300km/hr.
They can form within cyclones.",Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"An anemometer is a device used for measuring wind speed.

It consists of cup like structures to measure wind speed based on their movement.
It can also show the direction of the wind.",Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Safety Measures and Precautions
In case of a Cyclone or a Tornado, following are the safety measures to be taken on behalf of government and people:
Government should forecast cyclones 24 hours in advance with the help of satellites and radars.
Cyclone and Tornado shelters should be made for people living in cyclone prone areas. These are rooms made underground and away from shores having no windows.
Quick communication to government agencies, fishermen, ports to make necessary arrangements and minimize destruction.
As an individual, when cyclone or a tornado strikes, take shelter under tables, bow down and protect head and neck using arms.
Keep away from water in cyclone-hit areas as the water might be contaminated.
Stay inside houses.
Should not ignore warnings from meteorological department.
Should have all emergency numbers.
Avoid driving on roads full of water as the roads might be damaged or the vehicle may get stuck with water going inside the machinery.
Cyclone/Tornado can cause damage to electric poles and it may cause short circuit and electric shocks.
Cooperate and help others.",Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data

"Making a distance-time graph:
1. Mark the x-axis and y-axis and divide them in equal quantities.
2. Choose one scale to represent distance (for example, x-axis to represent distance where 1 km = 1 cm) and the other to represent time (for example, y-axis to represent the time where 1 min = 1 cm).
3. Mark the values of time and distance in the graph.
4. Mark the set of values of time taken and distance covered in that time by the object in the graph. For example, if 1 km is covered in 1 minute then mark 1 unit on both the x-axis and y-axis
5. Now draw lines parallel to x-axis and y-axis at the points that you have marked.
6. Mark the points where these lines intersect on the graph. These points show the position of the moving object.
7. Now join all the points of intersection and obtain a straight-line graph.
8. This is the distance-time graph of a moving object.

"The shape of the distance-time graph can be the following:

Shape of Graph         Interpretation 
Straight line

The object has a uniform or constant speed

Parallel to time-axis

It is a stationary object 

Curve shape

The object has a non-uniform speed",Relation,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"To find the speed of the distance-time graph
Speed = distance/time = (final position of object – initial position of object)/time taken by object

Also, the speed of the distance-time graph can be calculated by the Slope of a graph. The steeper the slope of the graph, the more is the speed of the object. For example, in the graph given below object A has a steeper slope. This means that object A is moving at a higher speed than object B

"Heat
Heat is the transfer of energy from a hot body. The sense of touch can be used to understand the degree of hotness or coldness of something. But the sense of touch is not reliable and cannot be always used to say how much hot anything is. Moreover, using the sense of touch can be risky in case of something being very hot. Thus, hotness of anything is measured in terms of TEMPERATURE in reliable way. To measure temperature a device called THERMOMETER is used.","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Unit of heat:
There are three units which are used to measure the temperature: Degree Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.",Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data

"Thermometer:
Thermometer is a device which is used to measure temperature. Thermometer is made of a long narrow glass tube; with a bulb at one end. The narrow tube appears as a continuous silver line; because it is filled with mercury. Mercury is a metal which is in liquid state at room temperature and it readily expands or contracts at the slightest change in temperature. Hence, mercury is used in thermometer.","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
Laboratory Thermometer: Laboratory thermometer is used to measure the temperature. The scale of temperature is graduated generally from –10°C to 110°C over the glass tube. Each division of temperature scale is further divided into 10 parts to read fraction of temperature.,"Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
Clinical Thermometer: Clinical thermometer is used to measure the body temperature. The scale of temperature is graduated from 35°C to 42°C and or from 94°F to 108°F. The temperature of human body always remains within this range and this is the range on the clinical thermometer. There is a kink near the bulb of clinical thermometer which prevents the automatic fall of mercury level.,"Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Digital Thermometer: In digital thermometer, reading of temperature is displayed digitally as in digital watches. This is safer because no mercury is used in this. It is important to note that mercury is a highly toxic substance.","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data

"Reading of thermometer and measuring of temperature:
Take a clinical thermometer and hold it horizontally with reading scale towards your eye.
Do not hold the thermometer from the bulb.
Rotate the thermometer slightly clockwise and anticlockwise. By doing this you will see a shiny thin silvery thread.
The end of the silvery thread shows the reading of temperature. If mercury lining ends at 37, the reading is 37°C.
Wash the bulb end of thermometer with an antiseptic solution.
Give two or three jerks slightly. By doing this the mercury level would fall. When it falls to 35°C or below, put it below the tongue and wait for one minute.
Take out the thermometer and read the temperature. Temperature would be near 37°C.
The normal body temperature is 37°C. This can differ from person to person",Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Use of Laboratory Thermometer:
Take some water in a beaker.
Take a laboratory thermometer and immerse its bulb end in water; holding it vertically. Ensure to dip whole portion of bulb end. The bulb end should not touch the bottom or side of the beaker.
Observe the movement of rise of mercury. When it becomes stable, take the reading of the thermometer.
Repeat this with hot water and take the reading.",Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Difference between clinical and laboratory thermometer:

Mercury level does not fall on its own, as there is a kink near the bulb to prevent the fall of mercury level.        Mercury level falls on its own as no kink is present.
Temperature can be read after removing the thermometer from armpit or mouth.        Temperature is read while keeping the thermometer in the source of temperature, e.g. a liquid or any other thing.
To lower the mercury level jerks are given.        No need to give jerk to lower the mercury level.

"Transfer of heat:
Heat is transferred by conduction, convection and radiation.

","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Conduction:
Transfer of heat from one particle to the adjacent particle is known as conduction of heat. In solids, heat is transferred by the process of conduction. In this process, the transfer of heat takes place through adjacent molecules","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Example: When one end of an iron rod is put over flame then part which is nearer to the flame is heated first and heat is gradually transferred to the other end of the rod. This happens because particles of iron rod which are nearer to the flame receive the heat and transfer this to the adjacent particles. Subsequently, the adjacent particles transfer the heat to the next adjacent particles. This process continues and heat reaches to the other end of the rod. Thus, heat transfer in solid takes place through conduction.","Examples, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Materials which allow heat to pass through it are called conductor or good conductor of heat, such as iron, copper, aluminium, etc. All metals are good conductors of heat. Since, mercury is a metal and found in liquid state at room temperature, that’s why it is used in thermometer
Since metals are the good conductor of heat that’s why kitchen utensils are made of metals or alloys of metals.","Definition, Reasoning, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Materials which do not allow heat to pass through them are called bad conductor or poor conductor of heat. They are also called insulators. Example: rubber, wood, plastic, etc. This is the cause that handles of frying pan or other kitchen utensils are made of plastic.","Definition, Examples, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Convection:
The transfer of heat because of movement of the molecules of the medium; via mass transfer; is called convection or convection of heat.

",Definition,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Water and air are bad conductors of heat. But they do become hot, in spite of being bad conductors. Heat transfer in fluids takes place through convection","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Convection in water: When water is heated in a pan, the particles of water which are near the source of heat; get heated first. Because of heating, they become light; and rise in water. The gap which is created because of rise of hot particles is filled by cold particles of water from the surrounding area. Thus a cyclical movement of particles begins and ends up heating the whole water of the pan. The cyclical movement in fluids because of heating is called convection current.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
Convection in air: Air gets heated because of convection; the way water gets heated. Air near the source of heat gets heated and rises above. This leaves a gap; which is filled by the colder air from the surrounding. The convection current thus starts in air which results in heating up of air.,"Definition, Reasoning, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
When you place your palm above a flame you will feel the hotness of the flame. But when you will place your palm below the flame the area will be colder. This shows how the colder air from below moves up; due to convection current.,Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Sea Breeze: In coastal areas, the breeze that moves from sea surface to the land is called sea breeze. This happens because, during daytime, land gets heated more quickly than water. As a result, warm air from land rises up; leaving a gap. To fill that gap, colder air from the ocean surface rushes towards the land. This phenomenon continues and a continuous flow of cold air keeps coming towards the land. This gives rise to the phenomenon which is called the sea breeze. Because of this, people living in coastal areas prefer to live in a sea facing house.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Land Breeze: In coastal areas, the breeze which moves from land towards the sea is called land breeze. In the night, the land cools down more quickly than the ocean surface. This makes the air over the water surface warmer than air over the land surface. Warmer air over the water surface rises in the air and air from the land rushes towards the water surface to fill the gap. This phenomenon continues which creates a flow of air from land to the sea. This phenomenon is called land breeze.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Radiation:
All hot bodies emit heat by the process of radiation. Radiation of heat does not require a medium. Sunlight comes to the earth because of radiation as there is no medium present between the atmosphere of the earth and the sun.

Reflection and absorption of heat: When heat falls over an object some of the heat is absorbed by the body and some of the heat is reflected. The temperature of an object increases because of absorption of heat.,"Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
In conventional room heater you can see the reflector attached with it. The reflector of the room heater reflects the heat towards the person sitting or standing near the room heater.,Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Reflection is the cause that umbrella is used to protect from heat of the sun in summer. Dark color absorbs more heat while light color reflects most of the heat. That’s why wearing light colored clothes is preferred in summer, dark colored clothes are preferred in winter.","Causes, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Dark clothes absorb more heat and keep one comfortable in winter. On the other hand, light clothes reflect most of the heat and keep one comfortable in summer.

Now-a-days many kitchen utensils come in black color, since utensils of black color absorb more heat and thus cooking becomes faster.","Property, Reasoning, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Woolen Cloth: Woolen clothes are used in winter season. Wool is a poor conductor of heat. In addition to it; air gets trapped in woolen fiber to further increase the poor conductivity of wool.

"Clinical Thermometer

The thermometer used by us or doctors to measure the body temperature when we have fever is a clinical thermometer.
The scale used to measure the temperature is known as Celsius scale denoted by °C or Fahrenheit denoted by °F.
It reads temperature from 35°C to 42°C or from 94°F to 108°F.
It consists of a long, slender and uniform glass tube with a bulb at one end containing mercury.
There is a small shining thread of mercury outside the bulb.
There is a kink near the bulb which prevents mercury level from falling on its own.","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
While using the clinical thermometer to measure the human body temperature some measures must be followed to ensure proper reading of temperature,Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"The measures are as follows:

Wash the thermometer properly with an antiseptic solution.
Hold it definitely and give a few jerks which will bring the level of mercury down below 35°C.
Place the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue.
Wait for one minute, take the thermometer out and note the reading keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.
This reading gives the exact body temperature.
It is necessary to state the temperature with its unit denoted by °C.
It should be handled with care as on hitting against some hard object it can break.",Reasoning,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Human body temperature

The normal temperature of human body is 37°C which may differ from person to person. It may be either slightly higher or slightly lower.
This value is derived from the average body temperature of a large number of hale and hearty persons.
The temperature of human body normally does not go below 35oC or above 42o If the body temperature goes beyond the defined value then it is necessary to consult a doctor.
That is the reason that clinical thermometer has scale ranging from 35oC to 42o","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Laboratory thermometer

Clinical thermometer can never be used for measuring the temperature of any object other than human body.
It is used to measure the temperatures in school or other laboratories for scientific purpose as they measure temperatures to a range higher than clinical thermometers.
One such thermometer is known as the laboratory thermometer with a scale generally ranging from –10°C to 110°C. It has a long stem with a silver bulb at the end unlike clinical thermometer.
The silver colour at the bulb normally points toward the presence of mercury which expands with the rise in temperature thereby raising the reading and contracts on lowering of temperature thereby lowering the reading.","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Precautions to be observed while reading a Laboratory thermometer

Precautions involved while observing the readings of laboratory thermometer are similar to those followed while measuring temperature using a clinical thermometer. But in addition to few other steps must be followed.

Should be kept vertical without tilting.

"It is common phenomenon and you all must have observed that when one end of utensil is heated, soon the other end also becomes hot
You also must have observed that while boiling water we heat the utensil only at bottom but the water at the top also becomes hot. Have you ever wondered why does this happen??
Another phenomenon that may make you wonder is the transmission of heat from the sun to the earth. It is a well-known fact that sun is far away from earth but still how can the heat travel such a huge distance and reach us
These are all due to some phenomenon that transfers the heat from one end to the other. Heat always transfers from the hotter end to the colder end. There are three modes through which the heat transfers from one end to the other, namely conduction, convection and radiation.","Reasoning, Types",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Conduction

The process of transferring of heat from the hotter end to the colder end of an object is known as conduction. Whenever a utensil is kept on flame it becomes hot and the heat travels from the base of the utensil to its handle. This is due to the transfer of heat from the hotter base of the utensil to cold handle. When this pan is removed from the flame and kept aside soon the utensil cools down. This is again due to transfer of heat form the hot utensil to cold surrounding.","Definition, Property, Causes",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Generally, the heat is transferred in solids by the process of conduction. It is the most important mode of heat transfer in solids than in liquids and gases.
But it is not necessary that all solids will conduct heat because there are many solids that are poor conductors of heat.
Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are known as conductors of heat. For instance, all metals like aluminium, iron and copper are conductors of heat.
Whereas those materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are known as poor conductors of heat. For instance, plastic, wood, water and air. They are also termed as insulators.","Property, Definition, Examples",Grade_7_Physics_Data
Therefore the concept of conduction is applicable to solids and that to only those solids which are good conductors of heat.,Property,Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Here temperature at side A is TA and the temperature at side B is TB.

There is a temperature difference as TA > TB.
So in this heat transfer will take place from A to B because we already learnt that heat transfers from the higher temperature to lower temperature.
Heat From side A starts losing heat and side B will gain heat.
So temperature at side A will decrease and that on side B will increase because it is gaining heat. But after sometime time the temperature will become equal on both the sides.
This situation is called steady state and after this no transfer of heat will take place because conduction comes into act only if there is a temperature difference.","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Convection

The method of transferring heat by the movement of the particles of substance away from the source of heat is known as convection. It takes place only in liquids and gases.","Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"On heating the water, the part of it near the flame gets heated up and expands due to which it becomes less dense and consequently rises up.
This creates a vacuum and the cold water from the sides slides down to occupy the space near the flame.
This water also gets heated up and rises.
Again the cold water slides down. So it is like a cycle that continues again and again until and unless the entire water is heated up.
This process continues unless the whole water present in the beaker gets heated up.
The air too gets heated up by this process. The air near the heat source gets heated up and rises. The cold air from the sides slides to occupy the space. In this way the air gets heated.
Due to this reason the air just above the flame of candle is hotter than the air at the side.
","Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Sea Breeze and Land Breeze

The land gets heated up by the heat radiated by the sun, much faster than the water during daytime. This heats up the air over the land and it expands and hence the hot air rises up and creates a vacuum. The cool air from the sea occupies the space left by the hot air. The warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle. The air from the sea is called the sea breeze.
But the reverse process takes place at night. The land cools down quickly and sea water remains hot. This heats up the air over the sea and it expands and hence the hot air rises up and creates a vacuum. The cool air from the land occupies the space left by the hot air. And hence the cool air moves from the land to the sea and is known as the land breeze.

","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Radiation

The heat given off from the sun cannot reach us by the process of conduction or convection because both the processes requires a medium to transfer the heat but due to absence of a medium such as air in maximum layers of space between the earth and the sun these processes cannot transfer the heat to the earth.
At this moment another process called radiation comes into act to transfer the heat radiated by the sun to the earth.
This heat transferring process doesn’t require any medium.
These are the form of electromagnetic waves. Their characteristic is that they can travel through vacuum and travel with speed of light (3X108 m/s). This propagation of heat from sun to earth involves both electric field represented by E and magnetic field represented by B.","Reasoning, Definition, Property",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Not only sun but all hot bodies radiate heat. That can propagate through medium or even in vacuum. Heating of room by a room heater, heating up of utensils kept over flame and then cooling down when kept away from heat are all due to radiation.","Reasoning, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
Human body releases heat to the surroundings and receives heat from it by the process of radiation. This can be proved using a simple example. You feel quite comfortable in a room with one person but if the same room has many people you feel hot due to the radiation of heat from the human body.,"Reasoning, Effects",Grade_7_Physics_Data
" All hot bodies radiate heat which falls on the nearby objects.

"But on the other hand dark colours are good absorbers of heat falling on them and as a result the dark coloured clothes absorb maximum amount of heat they receive and makes us feel warm and comfortable during winter.

","Property, Reasoning",Grade_7_Physics_Data
"Winters seasons are also accompanied with woollen clothes. This is due to the reason that wool being a poor conductor of heat traps the air in between the woollen fibres. The trapped air prevents the flow of heat from our body to the cold surroundings and vice versa thereby making us feel warm.

"Refraction: Introduction
The change of direction of light because of change of medium is known as Refraction or Refraction of Light. The ray of light changes its direction or phenomenon of refraction takes place because of difference in speed in different media.

The light travels at faster speed in rare medium and at slower speed in denser medium. The nature of media is taken as relative. For example air is a rarer medium than water or glass.

When ray of light enters from a rarer medium into a denser medium, it bends towards normal at the point of incidence. On the contrary, when ray of light enters into a rarer medium from a denser medium it bends away from the normal.

Ray emerging after the denser medium goes in the same direction and parallel to the incident ray

"Laws of Refraction:
The incident ray, refracted ray and normal to the interface of given two transparent media, all lie in same plane.
The ratio of sine of angle of incidence and sine of angle of refraction is always constant for the light of given colour and for the pair of given media.
The Second Law of Refraction is also known as Snell’s Law of Refraction.
that is, sini/sinr = constant
The constant is called refractive index of the second medium in relation to the first medium.


","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_10_Physics_Data
"A ray of light changes its direction when it enters from one medium to another medium. This happens because speed of light is different in different media. For example; the speed of light is 3 x 108 m/s (2.99x108 m/s) in vacuum and it is 2.98 x 108 m/s in air.

Refractive Index is the extent of change of direction of light in a given pair of media. The refractive index is a relative value of speed of light in the given pair of media. Thus, to calculate the refractive Index the speed of light in two media is taken.

Let the speed of light in medium 1 is v1 and in medium 2 is v2

Therefore; refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 (n21)

n21=v1/v2

Above expression gives the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1. This is generally denoted by n21.

Similarly, the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is denoted by n12.

"Absolute Refractive Index:When one medium is taken as vacuum and speed of light is taken in it, then the refractive index of second medium with respect to vacuum is called Absolute Refractive Index and it is generally denoted by nm.
The speed of light in vacuum is slightly faster than in air. Let speed of light in air is ‘c’ and the speed of light in given medium is ‘v’. Therefore, refractive index of the given medium:

nm=c/v

In an electric motor, a rectangular coil is suspended between the two poles- North and south of a magnetic field. The electric supply to the coil is connected to a commutator- a device which reverses the direction of flow of electric current through a circuit.

When an electric current is supplied to the coil of the electric motor, it gets deflected because of the magnetic field. As it reaches the halfway, the split ring which acts as commutator reverses the direction of flow of electric current. When the direction of current reverses the direction of forces acting on the coil also gets reversed. Thus here the change in direction of force pushes the coil, and it moves another half turn. Finally, the coil completes its one rotation around the axle. Continuation of this process keeps the motor in rotation ","Examples, Reasoning",Grade_10_Physics_Data

"18. Electromagnetic Induction: Can be explained by two experiments
(a) First Experiment  “Self Induction”

In this experiment, when the north pole of bar magnet is brought closer to the coil or away from the coil, we see momentary deflection in the needle of galvanometer on either side of null point. First right and then left.

Similarly, if we keep the magnet stationary and coil is made to move towards or away from the north pole of magnet. Again we will observe deflection in the needle of galvanometer.

If both bar magnet and coil are kept stationary, there will be no deflection in galvanometer. This experiment can also be done with the south pole of magnet, we will observe the deflection in galvanometer, but it would be in opposite direction to the previous case.

 It concludes that motion of magnet with respect to coil or vice-versa, changes the magnetic field. Due to this change in magnetic field lines, potential difference is induced in the same coil, which set up an induced current in the circuit.

(b) Second Experiment : Mutual Induction

In this experiment plug in the key that connects coil with battery and observe the deflection in galvanometer. Now plug out the key that disconnect the coil-1 from battery and observe the deflection in galvanometer, which will be in reverse direction.

Hence, we conclude that potential difference is induced in secondary coil (coil-2), whenever there is a change in current, in primary coil(coil-1) (by on and off of key).

This is because, whenever there is change in current in primary coil



Magnetic field associated with it also changes



Now, magnetic field lines around the secondary coil (coil-2) will change and induces the electric current in it (observed by the deflection of needle of Galvanometer in secondary circuit)

This process, by which changing of strength of current in primary coil, induces a current in secondary coil is called Electromagnetic Induction”

Faraday’s Experiment 1. One of the scientists Faraday performed series of experiments and based on the results he gave law on induction. He introduced the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction. Induction means to induce or to generate something. Electromagnetic Induction means production of electric current due to magnetic field. Magnetic field is capable of producing current in a conductor. Faraday took a coil and attached a galvanometer to it. As there is no battery attached therefore there is no source of current. He brought the magnet near the coil. When the magnet is moved towards the coil galvanometer showed deflection. Galvanometer even showed the deflection in the opposite direction when the magnet is taken away from the coil. When magnet was not moved there was no deflection in the galvanometer. This show current is related to magnet. Faster the magnet is moved the more is the deflection in the galvanometer.This showed more and more current flows if the magnet is moved very fast. Same effect was observed if the coil is moved and the magnet was not moved. Observation:- Relative motion between magnet and coil induced electric current in the coil.,"Definition, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data

This shows current flowing in one coil was able to induce current in another coil. Observation:- Relative motion between coils induces the electric current.","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Faraday’s Experiment 3. In this experiment he wanted to prove whether the relative motion between the 2 coils is essential for the induction of current. In this case he took a coil, one more coil attached with a battery.
When the circuit was open there was no current flowing through the coil. But as soon as the circuit was switched on there was deflection in the galvanometer. When the circuit was on continuously for longer period of time there was no current. When the circuit is switched off there was a deflection in the galvanometer in the opposite direction. And if the circuit is switched off for long time there was no deflection in the galvanometer.
He observed that the galvanometer showed momentarily deflection only when the system was undergoing a change. Observation:- Relative motion is not an absolute requirement for inducing current. There was induced current only when there is change in the system. Based on these 3 experiments Faraday gave 3 laws of Induction.","Definition, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Faraday’s laws of Induction. First law: -According to the first law an emf is induced in the circuit whenever the amount of magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes. Current was induced because of magnetic flux, as there is some current in the circuit therefore there will be some emf flowing in the circuit. Whenever the amount of magnetic flux linked with the circuit changes only at that time emf is induced. The induced emf will be there till there is change in the flux. When the magnet was moved then only there was change in the flux. As the magnet is moving the number of magnetic lines crossing the area is also changing. There is a change in the flux therefore there is induced emf. If the magnet is not moving, there will be no change in the amount of magnetic flux so there is no induced current.
 ",Definition,Grade_12_Physics_Data
Second law: - According to the second law the magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit. Emf which is induced will depend upon rate at which the magnetic flux is changing. Mathematically:-  Let Φ1 = flux at initial time t=0. Φ2 = flux after time t. Rate of change of flux=(Φ2 – Φ1)/t =dΦ/dt. According to Faraday’s law:- Induced emf e ∝ (dΦ/dt) Experimentally the constant of proportionality was found to be 1 in all cases. Therefore e=(dΦ/dt). Consider a coil which has N number of turns;Therefore e = N(dΦ/dt),"Definition, Formula",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Lenz’s law. According to Lenz’s law:-The polarity of the induced emf is such that it tends to produce induced current in such a direction that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. The (-) ive sign in given equatione= (-) (dΦ/dt)tells about the direction.According to Faraday’s law whenever there is change in the magnetic flux, emf is induced, as aresult there will be induced current. According to Lenz’s law the direction of the induced current will be such that it opposes the change in the magnetic flux. For example:- Consider a circuit where the magnetic flux is increasing, as a result flux will change and which induces the emf in the circuit, and as a result current will be induced in the circuit. The direction of the induced current will be such that it will oppose the cause which induced it. The induced current will be in such a direction that it decreases the magnetic flux. Note: - The induced current will try to oppose the change which is producing it. For example:- Consider a setup which has a coil, a magnet and a galvanometer. If the north pole of the magnet is brought near the coil, there will be a deflection in the galvanometer because of induced current. The direction of the induced current will be such that it opposes the motion of the magnet towards coil. Induced current will move the magnet away from the coil. As the north polarity of the magnet is brought near the coil as a result the induced current will be in such a direction that the face of the coil will have north polarity.The current will flow in the anti-clockwise direction. If the South Pole of the magnet was nearer to the coil then the current will flow in clockwise direction.","Definition, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
Lenz’s law: supports Conservation of energy. Lenz’s law obeys conservation of energy. Magnet is moving as a result current is getting induced and when the magnet is not moving there is no induced current in the coil.There is a mechanical energy involved with the movement of the as magnet as a result mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy which is produced by the induced current. Magnetic energy used in moving magnet is getting transformed into electrical energy which is produced by the induced current. This shows that Lenz’s law supports conservation of energy where one form of energy is getting transformed into another form. Work done in moving the magnet is dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.,Property,Grade_12_Physics_Data
Direction of Induced current: Lenz law. Induced current opposes CHANGE in flux. Example1: - Consider a region where magnetic field is acting in downward direction. Let magnetic field be 20T and it gets converted to 10T in the downward direction. As the magnetic field is changing therefore there is change in the flux which is equal to the decrease in the flux. As there is change in the flux there will be induced current. Flux of the induced current will try to oppose the decrease in the flux. Therefore the direction of induced flux will also be in the downward direction. Applying Fleming’s Right hand Thumb rule the direction of current will be given in the clockwise direction.,Property,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Example2:- Consider a magnetic field of 20T in the upward direction.If the magnetic flux is reduced to 10T in the downward direction. Both magnitude and the direction are changing. As flux is changing therefore there will be induced current. The direction of the induced flux will be in the opposite direction. i.e. upward direction. The induced flux will oppose the change which is the downward direction. The direction of the current will be in the anticlockwise direction. Example3:- Consider a region having downward magnetic field and there is a rectangular loop which is entering the region of magnetic field. As a result flux increases, the induced flux will oppose the increase in the flux.i.e. it will decrease the flux. Therefore induced flux will be in the upward direction. As a result the induced current will be in the anti-clockwise direction. Example4:- Consider a region having magnetic field in the downward direction and a rectangular loop which is coming out of the magnetic field with some velocity v. As it is coming out therefore flux is decreasing, current will be induced because of change in flux. Induced flux will try to oppose the change i.e. it will try to increase the flux. Induced flux is in the downward direction as a result the direction of current will be clock wise.","Examples, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"If the area within the magnetic field changes, then emf will be induced. The rectangular loop enters the magnetic field and goes out of the field. Initially there is no magnetic field from where the loop is starting, the moment the loop enters the magnetic field it experiences the change in the magnetic field at the boundary. When the loop was inside the magnetic field there was no change in the magnetic flux. But when the loop leaves the region of magnetic field there was decrease in the magnetic flux. Because when it leaves the magnetic field area keeps on decreasing. As area decreases therefore flux also decreases. At both the boundaries there is change in the area,as a result there is change in the flux. Therefore there will be induced current at the boundary.",Reasoning,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Mathematically:- The emf which is induced is known as Motional emf because this emf is induced due to the motion of the conductors.

In time Δt, loop covers small distance Δx. Decrease in the area =-(length Δx), Where (-) ive sign shows decrease in area. Decrease in flux = dΦ =B.ΔA =-BlengthΔx where ΔA=change in area.

Electrostatic potential is developed on the rod due to the accumulation of charges on both the ends of the rod when it enters the magnetic field. Because of electrostatic potential an emf is induced. This emf which was induced on the rod cannot be used for any practical purposes. As it is an open circuit therefore induced emf on the rod cannot be used. This induced emf is known as Motional Emf as it is generated because of motion of the rod inside the magnetic field. Expression for motional emfe= Blengthv Example: Flight.

As θ is changing from 0 to 900,900 to 1800, 1800 to 2700 and 2700 to 3600.

Eddy currents. Eddy currents are induced currents in the body of conductor when subjected to changing magnetic flux.They are also known as Foucault current after the name of the scientist Foucault. They are known as eddy currents as they are in the pattern of eddiesin the water. Consider an electromagnet when attached to battery because of the current magnetic field will be produced which will induce current in the metallic plate. The current will be in the form of eddies. The metallic plate will be slightly drifted in the air because of eddy currents.

"Examples of Eddy currents. Metal plate: In absence of magnetic field: No damping. Consider a metal plate which is suspended freely with the help of thread. As there is no magnetic field the plate will keep on oscillating without damping. Metal plate: In presence of magnetic field: Damping exists. If the magnetic field is present it oscillates but it stops after some time because of damping. As the plate keep on entering the magnetic plate and coming out of it. When it enters the region of magnetic field there is increase in area. As a result flux changes. As flux changes there is induced current.The direction of the induced current will be opposite to itsmean position. When the induced current leaves the magnetic field, again current will be induced but in the opposite direction. This effect of induced currents together gives the effect of eddy currents.
Because of induced current the motion is dampedas they are opposing the motion of the plate. Metal plate with slots: In presence of magnetic field: Damping reduced . When the plate oscillates the damping is reduced as there is lesser area. The eddy currents are less as a result damping is reduced. Eddy currents willoppose the motion of the plate and as they are reduced so there the damping is reduced. Conclusion: Eddy currents always have the tendency to oppose the relative motion. They are same eddies in the water because as the movement continues and currents also keep changing their direction depending on the change in flux. Therefore they look like eddies in the water. Eddy currents also cause damping as they oppose motion. Eddy currents are generated in the copper plate,while enteringand leaving the region ofmagnetic field. Cutting slots in the copper plate reducesthe effect of eddy currents.","Examples, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data

When the coil rotates with the angular velocity ω;
After time t, θ = ωt;
Φ(t) =BA cosθ = BA cosωt (because θ is changing as a result magnetic flux is also changing)

In the circuit there is source voltage(V) and an inductor with inductance = L.
In this circuit there are no resistors. There is one source EMF i.e. is the source voltage and another emf is self-induced.
As current is changing therefore the magnetic flux associated with the current also changes.
According to Faraday’s Lenz’s law whenever there is change in the flux a current is induced or an EMF is induced in the inductor.
As a result there will be self-induced EMF in the inductor which will oppose the change which is causing it.
Therefore V + e = 0.
Where V = source voltage and e = self- induced emf in the inductor L.
=> V - L(dI/dt) = 0 . Using e = -L (dI/dt)
=> Vm sinωt - L(dI/dt) = 0.
=>dI = (Vm sinωt dt /L)
Integrating both sides , therefore 0I∫dI = ∫ (Vm sinωt dt /L)
After simplifying, I = (Vm/L) [ -cosωt/ω] + constant
I = - (Vm/ ω L) cosωt + 0
(constant = 0 because as source voltage oscillate symmetrically about 0, therefore current should also oscillate about 0.)

Source voltage V = Vm sinωt and current I = Im sin (ωt + f).
VL = voltage across inductor, VC =voltage across capacitor, VR = voltage across resistor and V = source voltage.
Peak values: - VL =  Im XL , VC = ImXC , VR = ImR  and  V =Vm .
Resistor VR and I are in phase .Inductor I lag behind the VL.
In Capacitor VC lag behind the IL.
From the phasor diagram we can see that the VL  and  VC  are exactly in opposite direction with each other and are in same line.
The length of the phasors represents the peak values (Im XL, ImXC  and ImR)  .
From the circuit , VR + VC + VL = V.
Refer  figure(2)  from the phasors  a  right triangle is obtained whose hypotenuse =V .
Using  Pythagoras  theorem, V2R + (VC - VL)2 =  V2m
V2m = (ImR)2  +  [ImXC   -  Im XL]2
= I2mR2  + I2m(XC - XL)2
V2m  = I2m  [R2 + (XC - XL)2]
Vm  =  Im √( R2 + (XC - XL)2)
Comparing the above equation with V=IR , then R = √( R2 + (XC - XL)2).
Therefore  Z = √( R2 + (XC - XL)2)

"Resonance

Resonance is defined as the tendency of the system to oscillate at greater amplitude at some frequencies than at others.
It is common among the systems that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency and that frequency is known as natural frequency.
It is common among the systems which have the tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency.",Definition,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Examples:-

A pendulum oscillates at its natural frequency. If a push is given  to  pendulum its  amplitude increases. This frequency with which pendulum oscillates with a greater amplitude is known as the resonance frequency.


Swing. A child when sitting on a swing, he swings at his natural frequency. But if someone gives a push to the swing from the behind at the same frequency with which the swing was swinging earlier. Then the amplitude increases ,this is known as resonance and frequency is known as resonant frequency.",Examples,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Resonance of Series LCR circuit

At resonant frequency: Amplitude is  maximum.
In LCR circuit, current amplitude is given as:- Im  = (Vm/Z).
=> Im  = (Vm/√( R2 + (XC - XL)2)
At resonance ,Im = max => Z = minimum when (XC - XL) =0 => XC = XL
=>(1/ωC) = ωL => ω =(1/√LC).
This value is known as resonant frequency ω0 =(1/√LC) .
From the graph we can see that the value of Im increases with the value of ω, it reaches a maximum value which is ω0 and then again it decreases.
Important Note: -

Resonance is exhibited by a circuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit.
Only then the voltages across L and C cancel each other (as both being out of phase) and the current amplitude is (Vm/R), the total source voltage appearing across R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or RC

"Applications of Resonance

Resonance circuits have variety of applications. They are as  following:-

Tuning circuit of radio or TV set:-

Inside radio there is a circuit known as tuner circuit. This tuner circuit is  LCR circuit.
Every radio has an antenna which receives signals from multiple stations.
When we are tuning the knob of the radio to connect to particular station we are changing the capacitance of the capacitor in the circuit.
As capacitance  is  changing  the resistance  also changes and when the natural  frequency matches with the resonant frequency then the amplitude will attain the maximum value.
As a result we will be able to hear song.
When the amplitude is minimum we won’t be able to hear any song and when amplitude is near to maximum value we will be able to hear the song but the clarity won’t be very clear.","Examples, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"LC oscillations

LC  circuit consists of an inductor and a capacitor connected in a series.
Consider a circuit with a capacitor and an inductor, energy taken from the cell  and given to capacitor keeps oscillating between L & C.
The  oscillations  between L and C  are referred as  LC  oscillations.
When AC  voltage  is  applied  to  the  capacitor, it  will first  charge  and then will discharge ,again  will  charge and  discharge  and  this  process  will keep on continuing.
When the  capacitor is  fully charged  it will start discharging  and the charge is transferred to the inductor which is connected to the capacitor.
Because  of  change  in  the current  there  will be  change in  the magnetic flux  of the inductor in the circuit.
As a result there will be an emf induced in the inductor.
The EMF is given by e = - L (dI/dt). The self-induced emf will try to oppose the growth of the current.
As a result when the capacitor gets completely discharged all the energy stored in the capacitor will now be stored in the inductor.
The capacitor will become fully discharged whereas inductor will be storing all the energy.
As a result now the inductor will start charging the capacitor. The energy stored in the capacitor will start again increasing .
This cycle will keep on continuing.
These oscillations are known as LC  oscillations. Electric field energy and magnetic field  energy will keep oscillating.",Reasoning,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Transformers

A transformer is a device that changes voltage  from one value to another.
Power at the input end  is equal to the power at the output end.
Only the voltage will increase or decrease",Definition,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Alternating Transformer



Principle:-

Transformers work on the principle of Mutual induction.

Mutual Induction :- Suppose there are 2 inductors if some current flows through coil(1) ,there will be change in the current as a result there will be change in the magnetic flux, as a result there will be  change in the magnetic flux in the coil (2) and because of which emf is induced in the coil(2).

Construction:-

A Transformer consists of  :-

Primary coil:-
Primary coil has ‘n’ number of turns of wire over a piece of soft iron core.
It is the input end.
Secondary coil :-
Secondary coil has ‘n’ number of turns of any wire(like copper etc.) .
It is the output end as we receive output from this end.
Soft iron core :-
The hysteresis curve for iron is extremely thin because of which it covers minimum possible area.
As the  area  of  the  hysteresis  loop  of  iron is very less  therefore the energy lost by the transformer will be very less.
Permanent magnet is not suitable to use in transformers because the energy lost will be huge.


Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:

(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.



Working :-

An input voltage(AC source)  is applied across the primary coil. As  a result alternating current is produced in the primary coil.
The alternating current will give rise to alternating flux is produced in the coils.
Because of change in the magnetic flux emf will be induced .
There will be 2 Emfs produced in the circuit. 1. Self –induction 2. Mutual induction.
There will be self - induced emf in the primary coil , because of change in the magnetic flux in the primary coil there will be corresponding change in the magnetic flux  associated with the secondary coil which will give rise to induced emf in the secondary coil.
Mutual induction takes place in the secondary coil.
Induced emf in the primary coil = ep = -Np (df/dt)  
Where (df/dt) = rate of change magnetic flux and Np = number of turns in the primary coil.
Mutual induction in the secondary coil es = - Ns (df/dt)
Where Ns = number of turns in the secondary coil.
Assuming  resistance =0 in both primary and secondary coils.
Therefore ep = Vp (Voltage across primary coil)  
Vp = -Np (df/dt)  (equation(1))  and
es = Vs (Voltage across secondary coil) = - Ns (df/dt)  (equation(2))
Dividing equation(1) with (2):-
(Vp/Vs) = (Np/ Ns)
=>  Vs = (Ns/ Np) Vp
Power at the input end is same as the power at the output end.
Therefore Pintput = Poutput
=> IpVp =  IsVs",Reasoning,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Types of Transformers

There are 2 types of transformers:-

Step up transformer:-

This transformer amplifies the voltage. The output is higher than the input which is being supplied.
This condition will be true Vs > Vp only when  Ns > Np and Ip < Is.
Vs = (Ns/ Np) Vp
The output of the transformer à  voltage will be high and current will be less.
They are used in the power stations which supply power to the houses.


Step down transformer:-

For Vs < Vp  to be true then  Ns < Np .
Is > Ip so  that (Pintput  = Poutput).
Output is low voltage and high current.
This transformer is used in welding
","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Applications of Transformers

Transmission of power over long distances :-

Suppose there is a main power station, from there power is send to different sub area power stations and from there it is supplied to different houses.
At the main power station there is step-up transformer, it will amplify the voltage and current is reduced.
When the current is reduced therefore heating will be reduced to a great extent.
The power loss is minimized to a great extent till it reaches the area sub stations.
At the area substation step-down transformer is used. This transformer will reduce the voltage and then supplied to the houses.
The line power loss will be not very much as the distance between the houses and area power substation won’t be very large.


Transformers are used to regulate the voltage. Many appliances use voltage stabilizers which regulate the voltage so that the electronic devices are not harmed when there is fluctuation in the voltage.","Examples, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Energy losses in actual transformers

Flux leakage:-

 There are air gaps between the primary and the secondary coils  because of which the change of flux which is associated with the primary coil is not completely transferred to secondary coil.
In order to reduce the loss secondary coil can be wound over the primary coil.
For example:- In case of toroidal transformer cores, over the primary coil secondary coil is wound above it. As a result there is no air gap in between them.
","Definition, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Resistance of windings:-

The wire used for the windings has some resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire (I2R).
 If the area of the cross section of the wire is increased then the resistance will be reduced considerably.
So the thick wires are used in the windings of primary and secondary coils as a result resistance will be less .
The amount of heat lost because of wires will be less as resistance is minimal.
Eddy currents:-

Soft Iron core also gets heated up because of magnetic flux as a result eddy currents are developed in the soft iron core.
Core gets heated up because of eddy currents. This will harm the transformer core.
In order to prevent this laminated core can be used. Because of insulated covering eddy  currents are not able to produce the heating effects.","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Huygens Theory

According to Huygens light can be of wave nature.


He got this idea from the simple observation:
In an experiment conducted by Newton and Huygens, two rooms were considered with an obstruction in the middle. Newton considered a boundary and Huygens considered a door as the obstacle between rooms. In this experiment, light was switched on in one room.
According to Newton if light travels in straight lines then first room will be bright and some portions of the second room will become bright and the rest of the room will be dark.
Huygens observed that the first room became bright and the light spread in the second room as well, but it was not as bright as the first room.
Therefore Huygens’s proposed that light might be of a wave nature.
As the wavelength of light is so small thereforethe wave nature of light cannot be seen.
If the light is made to pass through a small portion which is comparable to the wavelength of light,then the wave nature of the light can be observed.
According to Huygens, Newton’s theory was not fully correct.Therefore he gave an idea that the light is of wave nature.
For example:-
If a light is made to pass through a big window then the light will appear as ray and not the wave.
But if the light is made to pass through a very small hole then the wave nature can be observed.
Huygens’s idea was not accepted because of the following reasons:-
As there was no experimental proof of what Huygens proposed.
There was Newton’s authority at that time.
Wave always needs a medium for propagation. This means light cannot propagate in vacuum.But sunlight is able to reach earth surface.
Conclusion given by Huygens formed the basis of wave nature of light.","Definition, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Wavefront

Wave front is defined as locus of all points having same phase at a given instant of time.
The shape of wavefront depends on the shape of the source of disturbance.
A wavefront is always normal to the light rays.
A wavefront does not propagate in the backward direction. There are 3 types of wavefronts:-

Cylindrical wavefront(cylinder in shape)","Definition, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Spherical Wavefront

When the source of light is a point source the wavefront formed will be spherical wavefront.
Point source means the source of light is so small that it is considered as point. It can be considered as dimensionless.
For example: - Ripples in water are in the form of concentric circles which are spherical wavefronts.","Definition, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Plane Wavefront

When the small part of a spherical or cylindrical wavefront originates from a distant source like infinity then the wavefront which is obtained is known as plane wavefront.
For example: -Rays coming from infinity like Sun.","Definition, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Cylindrical Wavefront

When the source of disturbance is a slit (i.e. line source) then the wavefront is cylindrical because all the points are equidistant from the source and they lie on the surface of the cylinder.
For example: - In the figure we can see when rays of lightfall on a lens after coming out of lens, they will converge at a point.
The waves are bending and converging at a point so the shape of the wavefront is in the form of cylinder.
Many concentric circles are formed and the wavefront is in the form of cylinder.","Definitoin, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Huygens Principle

Huygens principle states that each point of a wavefront is the source of secondary wavelets (small waves) which spread in all directions with the speed of the wave.
The new wavefront is formed by drawing a line tangent to all the wavelets.",Definition,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"For example:-

If a stone is thrown in the river,waves will be formed surrounding that point.
These waves look like concentric circles and they are known aswavefronts.
The wavefronts gradually spread in all the directions.

Secondary wavefront are formed fromeach point on the Primary wavefront.
The common tangential line that envelopes these secondary wavefronts will further give rise to other secondarywavefronts.
All wavefronts will gradually fade after some time.
Conclusion: - According to Huygens principle, every point on a wavefront give rise to secondary wavelets which spread out in all the directions with the speed of a wave.",Examples,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Using Huygens principle we can determine the new position of the wavefront after time t.
Mathematically: To calculate the new position of the wavefront after time t.
Let the initial time ti =0.
Each wave will travel =vt1where v=speed of the wave.
Distance travelled by each wave is equal to the radius of the sphere.
Therefore radius of sphere = v t1.
Common tangent joining all the spheres will give the position of the new wavefront at time t=t1.
There are 2 possibilities: - outer tangent and inner tangent.
The amplitude of the back wave is 0. Therefore the back wave is neglected and the forward wave was considered.
New wave front will arise from each point on the outer wavefront.
Therefore the distance covered by these wavefronts = vt2.
And again spheres will be obtained and by drawing common tangent will tell the position of all the new wavefront after time t2.
Again back wave is neglected and forward wavefront is considered.
This shows the wavefront keep on spreading with time.",Reasoning ,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Reflection of plane waves

When all the points on an incident wave which are in same phase are considered together, incident wave front will be obtained.
After reflection incident waves will bounce back.
Waves which are lighter will touch the surface before the waves which are denser.
Let the time taken by some portion of wavefront to interact with the boundary is τ.
As soon as incident wavefront touches the boundary, every point on the incident wavefront will give rise to secondary wavelets.
The wavefront for the secondary wavelets will be a sphere.
After some time t1 incident ray is at some other point, again it will give rise to wavefront.
Radius of the wavefront = velocity (speed) of the wave x time taken=vxτ.
When other points interact with the boundary gradually, both τand radius will keep decreasing.
As a result the tangent of all these points will give rise to reflected wavefront.
Mathematically:-
Speed of the wave =v
Time taken by B to reach point C i.e. BC= vx τ
At point A it will give rise to secondary waves, therefore radius=vτ.
After some time τ will keep on decreasing.
Therefore as it moves towards the point C the radius of the sphere (wavefront) will keep on decreasing.
If a tangent is drawn then a reflected wavefront is obtained.","Definitoin, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Refraction of plane waves

In refraction, when any point of the incident wavefront interacts with boundary, secondary waves are generated and they will have some velocity.
Case 1: Rarer medium to denser medium:-
The waves generated in medium 1 will have velocity as v1τ.
Waves in denser medium will have lesser velocity as compared to velocity in rarer medium.It is given as v2τ.
The wavefront will not be a circle as the waves in two different mediums are travelling with different velocities.
To prove Snell’s law:-
Consider two triangle’s ABC and AEC :-
In triangle ABC sin i= (BC/AC) and sin r=(AE/AC)
 By dividing (sin i/sin r) = (BC/AC) x (AC/AE)
Therefore (sin i/sin r) = (BC/AE) =(v1τ) /(v2τ)
=> (sin i/sin r) =(v1/v2)
Refractive index n; =(c/V) 
Where c = velocity of light in vacuum and V=velocity of light in medium.
Therefore (sin i/sin r) = (c/n1)/(c/n2)
Where n1 and n2 are the refractive index in medium 1 and 2 resp.
Snell’s law (sin i/sin r) = (n1/ n2). Hence proved.
Case 1: Angle of incidence is greater than angle of refraction, i>r
Light rays bend towards the normal when it travels from rarer medium to denser medium.
=> v1> v2
Where v1 = velocity in denser medium and v2 =velocity in rarer medium.
Case 2: Angle of incidence is less than angle of refraction, i<r.
Light rays bend away from the normal when it travels from denser medium to rarer medium.
=>v1< v2
Conclusion: Velocity in rarer medium > Velocity in denser medium.
This is contrary to Newton’s theory.
Huygens theory was able to prove all the laws of refraction. That is why his theory was accepted.
Case 2:- Denser medium to rarer medium.
In refraction any point of the incident wavefront interacts with boundary, secondary waves will be formed and these secondary waves will have some velocity.
Velocity in denser medium is lesser than the velocity in the rarer medium, i.e.v1< v2.
=> Radius of wavefronts in rarer medium < Radiusof wavefronts in denser medium.","Definition, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Concave mirror:-
The concave mirror converges the incident wavefront at the focus which is at the same side.
Effects ofPrism,convex lens and concave mirrorcan be explained in terms of wave front.
According to Huygens velocity of the light in the denser medium is lesser than the velocity in the rarer medium.
In a prism or convex lens, velocity of wavefront inside them is lesser than the velocity outside.
Consider the fig the wave (1) will travel a very little portion of the denser medium whereas wave (2) will travel more portion of the rarer medium.
This means the velocity of wave (2) is less for longer period of time because of which they take more time to come out of the prism.
Wave (1) travel with lesser speed for small amount of time. So they reach faster.
In case of convex lens the waves which are in middle will travel maximum portion of the denser medium. Therefore they travel more time in the denser medium.
They have less velocity as a result they will take more time as compared to the waves at the edges.
As the lens is thinner at both the edges.","Definition, Reasoning ",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Doppler’s effect

Doppler Effect is the shift in frequency of light when there is relative motion between the source and observer.
It is used to measure the speed of a receding object.
When the source is moving away from the observer then the wavefronts have to travel a greater distance to reach the observer.
When a star is moving away from the earth the wavelength in the middle of the visible region of the spectrum moves towards the red end of the spectrum.
As a result star looks more reddish when moves away from the earth.
This is known as red shift phenomenon.
When the waves are received from a sourcemoving towards the observer, there is an apparent decrease in wavelength. This is called blue shift.
The fractional change in frequency (Δν/ν)=(–vradial/c),
Where vradial= component of the source velocity along the line joining the
observer to the source; vradial is considered positive when the source moves away from the observer.
Thus, the Doppler shift can be expressed as:
(Δν/ν) = (–vradial/c);
It is valid when the speed of the source is small compared to that of light.","Definition, Formula",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Superposition of waves

Superposition of waves is defined as the resultant displacement produced by a number of waves is the vector sum of displacements produced by each of them.
Two 2 different waves add up to form a single wave and whose displacement will be given by vector sum of individual waves.
There are 2 types of superposition:-
Constructive overlap:-When two waves overlap to produce a bigger wave that is known as constructive overlap.

Case 1:-
Consider two coherent sources S1 and S2emitting light waves of same frequency and constant phase.
The wave fronts of both the sources will overlap with each other.

Path difference is defined as the difference in the paths from both the sources to a particular point.

Case 2:- Considering a point Q which is not equidistant from the 2 sources and the path difference S1Q - S2Q = 2λ(integral multiple)

Therefore waves from S2 will reach exactly 2 cycles earlier than waves from S1. Waves reach at S2early by 2λ as compared to S1.
One cycle corresponds to λ and two cycles correspond to 2λ.

Interference is a phenomenon of superposition of 2 waves to form a resultant wave of greater, lower or the same amplitude.

"Young’s double slit experiment (YDSE)

The Young’s experiment shows that matter and energy can display both wave and particle characteristics.

Purpose of double slit experiment is as follows:-

In order to prove the wave nature of light.
To explain the phenomenon of interference.
Two coherent sources of light were taken in order to maintain the 0 or constant phase difference between the sources of light.

Experimental set-up1:-
Young took an ordinary source of light(S) such as light bulb.
The light was made to pass through a very small slit S (which was comparable with the wavelength of light).
The light coming from Source S was made to pass through two small slits S1 and S2 which were separated by a very small distance d.
One screen was kept in front of these 2 sources.
Observation1:-

He observed alternate dark and light bands were formed on the screen.
Setup 2:-

Now he took 2 light bulbs i.e. 2 non coherent sources of light and placed a screen in front of them.
Observation 2:-

He observed there were no alternate bands of light formed on the screen.
Conclusion:-
When coherent sources of light were taken then the phenomenon of interference is taking place.
When non-coherent sources were taken phenomenon of interference was not taking place.
The source S illuminated the sources S1 and S2 as a result the light from S1 and S2 become coherent.
S was the source of bothS1 and S2, therefore if there is any change in the phase of the source there will be change in the both sources also.
Therefore both S1 and S2 will be always in phase with each other.",Reasoning,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Why alternate sources of light bands were seen

When the ordinary light source was made to pass through small slit then the wavefront of semicircle shape will be formed.
Wavefronts are in semicircle shape because of obstacles on both the sides.
In the figure red bands represents crests and yellow represents troughs.
When these wavefronts passes through the 2 small slits again the wavefronts will arise.
There will be points where red and yellow will also overlap with each other.
Red + Yellow and Yellow + Red à  Destructive interference à Intensity low
Yellow + Yellow and Red + Red à Constructive interference à Intensity high
Because of constructive and destructive interference there are alternate dark and light bands seen on the screen.
Conclusion: -
When the light wave is originating from the 2 coherent sources they overlap with each other both constructively and destructively.
As a result alternate light and dark bands of light is shown on the screen.
This phenomenon of overlapping of light waves giving rise to regions of higher amplitude and regions of lower amplitudeis known as interference.
Interference is a property related to the wave nature of the light.
Young’s Double slit experiment proved that the light is of wave nature which was proposed by Huygens principle.
 

Important resultsdrawn from the above experiment:-
Bands were formed as a result of interference and interference was due to the overlapping (either constructive or destructive) of waves.
Constructive and destructive overlapping depends on the path difference.
If the path difference is integral multiple of λ = constructive interference.
If path difference is non integral multiple of λ =destructive interference.
Calculation of path difference

Let S1 and S2 are the sources and consider a point P where we have to calculate the intensity.
Path difference = S2P-S1P
Using Pythagoras theorem :- (S1P) 2 = D2 + (x-(d/2)) 2 equation(1)
Where D=distance of the screen from 2 slits, x= position of the point where intensity has to be found.
Similarly (S2P)2 = D2+ (x+(d/2)) 2 equation(2)
Where d=distance between the 2 small slits.
Subtracting (2) and (1) => (S2P)2 - (S1P) 2 =(x+(d/2)) 2 - (x-(d/2)) 2
On simplifying (S2P)2 - (S1P) 2 =2xd
=> (S2P+S1P)(S2P- S1P)=2xd
=>(S2P- S1P) =(2xd)/(S2P+S1P)
If d<<D ; x<<D(screen is placed quite far away from the slit arrangement)
=> (S2P+S1P) (are almost same as D).
=> S2P+S1P =2D
Therefore (S2P- S1P) = (2xd)/(2D)
Path difference =(xd)/(D)Equation(2)

xn+1 =(((n+1)λD)/d)
β =xn+1 - xn
=(((n+1) λD)/d) – ((nλD)/d)

Central fringes gets shifted by – θ if the source gets shifted by θ.

When the light passed through one slit a different type of pattern was observed on the screen.
The pattern which was observed had a central maximum band and which was very wide as compared to interference pattern.
There were alternate dark and bright bands and their intensity was decreasing on both the sides.
The central maxima,was very wide whereas corresponding secondary maxima and minima were reduced in the intensity.
The change in the pattern was formed due to diffraction instead of interference.

At the central point θ =0. This implies path difference =0.
This means all the parts of the slit will contribute completely. Therefore the intensity is the maximum.
Central Maximum occurs at θ =0.
 

Problem:-The light of wavelength 600nm is incident normally on a slit of width 3mm.Calcluate the linear width of central maximum on a screen kept 3m away from the slit?

Answer:-

Wavelength λ =600nm =600 x10-9m.

Width of the slit a =3mm=3x10-3m.

Distance of the screen D=3m.

Condition for minima:-a sinθ =nλ

=>a sin θ =λ

=>sin θ = (λ/a) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=>θ =(600 x10-9)/(3x10-3)

=>(x/D) = (600 x10-9)/ (3x10-3)

=> x= (600 x 10-9 x3)/ (3 x10-3)

x=600 x 10-6m.

Therefore width =2x = 1200 x 10-6m

Width = 1.2 mm

Diffraction pattern Secondary Maxima

Scientist Fresnel found that secondary maxima occurred when the value of θ is:

θ =(n+(1/2)) (λ/a)
For n=1 =>θ =(3λ)/(2a) = (1.5λ/a) (equation 1)
Where = (3λ)/ (2a) it lies midway between 2 dark fringes.
Suppose if the slit is divided into 3 parts ,
Consider the first 2/3rd part of the slit ,
Path difference = (2/3) a x θ
=(2/3) a x(3λ/2a) using (equation 1)
Path difference =λ.
The λ is getting divide into 2 halves with path difference =λ/2 and λ/2.
Each of λ/2 gets cancel with another λ/2.
Contribution from (2/3rd) part gets cancel out with each other.
Therefore only (1/3rd) contributes to I(Intensity).
Intensity ≠ 0.
Intensity is reduced.
For n=2 => θ =(5 λ)/(a)
Only (1/5th) part will contribute.
For n=3 =>θ =(7 λ)/(2a)
Only (1/7th) part contributes.
 

Slit divided into 3 parts

 

Diffraction pattern for Minima

Condition to get minima on the diffraction pattern:
θ = (n λ/a); n= (+-) 1, (+-2)…
For n=1, =>θ = (λ/a)
Suppose the slit is divided into small parts. For every M1in the portion LM there exists another M2 in MN.
From the figure it is clear that the contribution from all elements inLM (M1) will cancel out the contribution from all elements MN (M2).
Therefore net intensity I=0 at θ = (λ/a).
Minima occur at θ = (nλ/a). => aθ =nλ
=> a sinθ =nλ.
Path difference = (nλ/a).
Minima will occur ata sin θ =n λ. Where a =width of the slit,λ = wavelength of the light used.","Definiiton, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Resolving Power of Optical instruments

Resolving power is defined as the inverse of the distance between two objects which can be just resolved when viewed through the optical instrument.
Optical instruments should be able to display two separate images as distinct two separate images.
Suppose if we are seeing 2 stars in the sky using telescope, and they are very closely placed to each other, they should not be displaced as one star.
Instead they should be displaced as two separate stars. The ability to see them as separate 2 stars is known as resolving power.
For example: -
Consider 2 rooms one is lit and another is dark.The room which is lit we are able to see everything clearly whereas in second room we are not able to see properly.
This is because the resolving power with which we are viewing second room is not good.
If the resolving power is better the image will be clearer.So everything can be seen clearly.","Definition, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Diffraction in resolving power of telescope

In telescope resolving power plays an important role.
In telescope there are 2 lenses one is objective lens and other is eye-piece.
The purpose of objective lens to create an image at the second focal length of the objective and the first focal length of eyepiece.
The image which iscreated will be inverted and diminished.
The purpose of eye-piece is just to enlarge the image formed by the objective lens at the focal length.
The purpose of objective lens is to resolve images as distinct.
For example: -
If we are viewing 2 different stars the purpose of objective lens will be to resolve the stars as 2 distinct stars.
Whenever a ray of light passes through the objective lens it should get focus at a particular point.
But because of the phenomenon of diffraction instead of focussing at a specific point the image gets focussed in and around that area.
Limit of Resolution :
Limit of resolution is defined as the angle subtended by the distant objects on the objective.
This means how small an object can be resolved by the telescope.
It is denoted by dθ.
Case 1:-The limit of resolution is 0.2 radians.
That is telescope can resolve up to 0.2 radians.
Case2:- The limit of resolution is 20 radians.
The telescope can resolve up to 20 radians.
Lesser the limit of resolution better is the resolving power.
Resolving Power (R.P) ∝ (1/dθ).
dθ∝ (λ/D)
=>Limit of resolutiondθ =(1.22 λ/D)
Whereλ =wavelength of the wave, D =diameter of the objective lens.
If the diameter of the objective lens is large then more and more light can pass through it.
As a result telescope will be able to give more detailed image.
Resolving Power:
Resolving power is defined as the relationship between limit of resolution and resolving power.
Resolving Power (R.P) ∝(1/dθ).
dθ ∝ (λ/D)
Where diameter of the aperture of the convex lens D = (2a) and f=focal length of the lens.
When a parallel beam of light is incident on the convex lens it should get focussed at one single point.
But diffraction occurs when the distance measured is comparable to the wavelength of the light.
Therefore instead of single point a spotappears. This spot appears because of diffraction.
There will be one central maximum surrounded by dark band (minima) then secondary maxima and then secondary minima.
Experimentally the radius of Central maxima= (1.22λ/D).
P of a telescope ∝(D/1.22λ).
Conclusion:-A telescope must have a larger diameter objective for better resolution.","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Diffraction in resolving power of Microscope

In case of microscope resolving power helps to magnify the image.
Resolution helps to distinguish between the small similar particles of an object when they are so closely placed with each other.
When the distance between 2 points is comparable to the wavelength then diffraction occurs.
Image formed due to the diffraction pattern vθ = v (22λ/D).
The minimum distance for the object to be resolved is v (22 λ)/(D)andbeyond this point the object cannot be resolved.
Minimum separation between objects to get resolved is given as:-
dmin = (v (1.22λ/D))/m  
Where m =magnification.
dmin= (1.22λ/D) f;
Where f=focal length.
tanβ = (D/2f)
Whereβ = angle made by the objective lens at its focus, D=diameter and f=focus.
tanβ = 1.22f λ
Therefore dmin = (1.22λ)/(tanβ)
dmin= (1.22λ)/(2tanβ) if β≈ small, tanβ≈ sinβ≈β
dmin= (1.22 λ)/(2 sin β)
Suppose if the medium between the object and the objective lens has refractive index n.
dmin= (1.22λ)/ (2n sinβ) where n sinβ = numerical aperture of objective lens.
Therefore dmin= (1.22λ)/ (2n sinβ) is known as numerical aperture of the objective lens.
Resolving Power(R.P) of a microscope ∝ (1/dmin).
This implies resolving power decreases as the distance increases.
=>P. =(2n sin β)/(1.22 λ)
Conclusion:-Resolving power can be increased by choosing medium of higher refractive index.",Reasoning,Grade_12_Physics_Data

The distance travelled by the light waves for the spread to occur = ‘z’(the angular spread due to diffraction)
The spread is given as = (z λ/a)
Where (z λ/a) = a where a =width of the diffracted beam.
z ≈ (a2/ λ).This distance is known as Fresnel distance.
Fresnel distance describes the distance at which spread due to diffraction becomes comparable to the width of the slit or not.
This is the boundary of ray optics and wave optics.

"Polarizing and unpolarized light wave

Polarized wave: - Polarized wave is defined as the vibration of the wave confined to specific plane.
 

In case of polarized wave the vibrations takes place in one plane not in multiple planes and it is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
For example: -
Vibrations of a rubber. It will vibrate randomly in all different directions. But when it is passed through a small slit then it will vibrate only in one plane.
 

Unpolarized wave:-Unpolarized wave is defined as the plane of vibration which changes randomly in short intervals of time.
In case of unpolarized wave the vibrations takes place in multiple planes and it is perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
 

What is polarization?

Polarization is the process of transforming unpolarized light into polarized light.

Polarization: Transverse vs. Longitudinal waves

In case of transverse waves there are many different ways in which particles can oscillate.

When an unpolarized beam of light falls on boundary, reflected wave and refracted wave are partially polarized.
An incident wave is an unpolarized light .Some of the rays will get reflected and some gets refracted.
Most of the light waves that reflected were polarized waves, which were parallel to the plane.
Most of the rays along the refracted ray were unpolarized waves with one or two polarized components.
Refracted Ray à More unpolarized and Reflected rayà more polarized.
If the angle of incidence varies more and more unpolarized light was able to pass through the surface.
At one particular value of angle of incidence there was maximumpolarization in the reflected ray.
Above and below the value of angle of incidence, both reflected and refracted rays were partially polarized.

"ROADMAP TO THE DISCOVERY OF ELECTRON:
William Crookes, in 1870, discovered that on applying a strong electric field between cathode and anode (kept under discharge tube at low pressures), some rays were emitted by the cathode. These rays were noticed as a bright fluorescent on the glass adjacent to the cathode
These rays were called as cathode rays by William Crookes
In 1879, he proposed that these cathode rays are a bunch of fast moving negatively charged particles
Then, J. Thomson (1856-1940) validated the above hypothesis. He found that when ultraviolet radiation falls on a metal surface (or when metal surface is heated), few negatively charged particles are released by the metal surface.
He used electric and magnetic fields (across the discharge tube), mutually perpendicular to each other and the emitted electrons
He was the first to find the values of; speed(v), and the charge to mass ratio (e/m) of the cathode ray particles, experimentally
He found the speed of particles to be about 0.1 to 0.2 times the speed of light (), and the charge to mass ratio (e/m)
He also found that the e/m ratio to be constant, irrespective of the material used as an emitter. This proved the universal nature of cathode ray particles.
In 1897, he termed this negatively charged cathode ray particles as electron, and this name was used for the first time.
A. MIlikan, in 1913 performed experiments to calculate the charge on an oil drop (popularly known as Milikan’s oil drop experiment)
He observed that, every time the charge came to be an integral(whole number) multiple of a small charge (), which is actually the charge on an electron
MIlikan concluded that charge on a matter is quantized (discrete)","Property, Reasoning, Definition",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"ELECTRON EMISSION:
The process of emission of electrons from the metal surface when a certain amount of energy is absorbed by the metal, is called electron emission
There are free electrons on the metal surface, present in the outermost (valence) shell that are loosely bound to the nucleus
These electrons are emitted when a certain minimum amount of external energy is provided to the metal surface. This least value of energy is called work function of metal (denoted by Φ0)
The unit of Φ0 is electron volt(eV). 1eV is defined as the energy needed to accelerate an electron through the potential difference of 1volt(V).
Work function of a material depends mainly on the nature of metal, and electronic configuration of metal (meaning the number of valence shell electrons, lesser the number, lesser the work function)","Definition, Property, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"TYPES OF ELECTRON EMISSION:
There are 3 types of electron emission; a) thermionic emission, b) field emission, and c) photoelectric emission

Thermionic emission:
Thermionic emission is the process in which thermal energy is used to overcome the work function of metal in order to force out the free electrons from the metal surface. It is used in thermionic converter
In thermionic converter, comparatively hot electrode emits electrons on receiving thermal energy. These electrons move towards the comparatively cold electrode, thus producing thermionic current (and power).
Field Emission:
Field emission is the process where free electrons are forced out of metal surface using a strong electric field ()
It is used in field electron microscopes, vacuum nano electronics and other such fields of study.
Photoelectric Emission:
Photoelectric emission is the process where free electrons are removed from a metal surface using a light of certain frequency on that metal
It is used in image sensor (where optical image is transformed into electric signals), applied mainly in digital cameras.
It is also used in gold leaf electroscope,used to detect and measure static electricity.

Metal cap, on acquiring some charge passes it to the metal stem and the gold leaf inside the evacuated chamber through the instructor. The gold leaf having the same charge as the metal stem gets repelled and move away as shown in the figure.","Types, Definition, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT- A BRIEF HISTORY:
Hertz, in 1887 discovered the phenomena of photoelectric effect for the first time
As he was experimenting on the generation of electromagnetic waves by spark discharge, he noticed that sparks around the detector loop were intensified when ultraviolet radiation fell on the emitter plate
Radiation falling on the metal surface provided free electrons enough energy to neutralize the attractive force of positive ions and escape themetal surface to intensify the sparks across the metal loop.


Hallwach and Lenard during 1886-1902, researched the process of photoelectric emission
They experimented on negatively charged zinc plate and found that on absorbing ultraviolet light zinc plate became neutral, losing its net positive charge. On further absorption of ultraviolet radiation, neutral zinc plate became negatively charged.
This proved that electrons are released from the metal surface when ultraviolet radiation is incident on it
They also observed that electrons are not emitted when the frequency of light incident is less than a specific least value, called the threshold frequency. Threshold frequency depends on the nature of material used as an emitter
Some metals like zinc, magnesium etc. emitted electrons only by absorbing ultraviolet light. But, alkali metals like sodium potassium etc. could also absorb visible radiation to emit electrons, and so they were called photosensitive materials.
So, the process in which falling of electromagnetic radiation on the metal surface results in the emission of electrons is called photoelectric effect. And the electrons released due to photoelectric effect are called photoelectrons","Definition, Property, Relation, Reasoning, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT:
 

The experimental setup consists of:

Evacuated tube consist of photosensitive plate (emitter) and the metal plate (collector), so that electrons could freely flow from emitter to collector without any air resistance
Photosensitive plate (emitter) to absorb visible light and emit electrons
Metal plate (collector) to receive electrons emitted from the emitter, thus constituting a photoelectric current flowfrom collector plate to the emitter plate (opposite to the flow of electrons)
Monochromatic light of short wavelength (meaning high frequency)
Battery to accelerate emitted electrons through a potential difference
Voltmeter to measure the potential difference between the emitter and the collector plates due to photoelectric current flow
Ammeter to measure the value of photoelectric current.",Reasoning,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT:
Variation of photoelectric current with intensity of radiation absorbed:

When the values of photoelectric current were plotted against the different values for intensity of light, it was observed to be a straight line passing through the origin.
It proved that Photoelectric current, which is number of photoelectrons flowing per unit time, is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light


Variation of photoelectric current with the potential applied:

Case-1-When collector plate was kept at higher potential (accelerating potential) with respect to the emitter.

As the positive potential of collector rises, photoelectric current rises for a certain period of time because the electrons emitted experience a strong attractive force by the collector
On further increasing the positive potential, photoelectric current reaches a maximum value, beyond which it remains fixed even when positive potential is increased. This is because number of free electrons in a metal surface is always fixed.
This maximum value of photoelectric current beyond which it remains fixed, no matter how high the positive potential gets, is called the saturation current.
Case-2-When collector plate was kept at lower potential (retarding potential) with respect to the emitter.

As the negative potential of collector rises, photoelectric current falls. This is because the electrons emitted will experience a strong repulsive force from the collector
As the retarding potential is further increased, even the electrons having maximum kinetic energy will be repelled by the repulsive force of the collector, and hence, the photoelectric current becomes zero
This corresponding minimum value of retarding (negative) potential for which the photoelectric current becomes zero is called stopping potential, or cut-off potential. It is denoted by (V0).
Mathematically, stopping potential could be expressed as Kmax=eV0, V0=stopping potential, Kmax=kinetic energy, e=charge on an electron


Case-3-When the variation of photoelectric current was plotted against the potential for 3 different values of intensity of incident light (keeping the frequency constant).

It was observed that stopping potential was constant for all the values of intensity. Thus, stopping potential is independent on the intensity of incident light.
On the other hand, saturation current got higher for higher values of intensity of absorbed light


Variation of photoelectric current with the frequency of incident light:

The variation of photoelectric current was plotted against the potential for 3 different values of frequency of incident light (keeping the intensity constant)
It was observed that saturation current was constant for all the values of frequency. Thus, saturation current is independent on the frequency of incident light.
However, stopping potential got higher in the negative direction for higher values of frequency of absorbed light


It was also found that, after reaching a certain minimum frequency value, stopping potential followed a linear relationship with the frequency of incident light.
This minimum value of frequency of incident light required for photoelectric emission to take place was called as threshold frequency
The value of threshold frequency is fixed for a specific material, and it changes from one material to another","Reasoning, Relation, Formula, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT
Photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light
Saturation current increases if intensity of radiation increases
Stopping potential doesn’t depend on the intensity of light


Sopping potential, and maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons, are linearly related to the frequency of incident light
For every material, there is a minimum value of frequency (threshold frequency) of incident light required for photoelectric emission to take place, below which no photoelectric effect occurs


Photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process, meaning there is no time lag between the incident light and the emission of free electrons (photoelectrons).","Property, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT AND WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT:
As per the wave theory, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron should be affected by the change in intensity. But, the experiments on photoelectric effect showed that maximum kinetic energy doesn’t depend on the change in intensity. So, this was the first inconsistency of the wave theory with the experiments.
Wave theory didn’t talk about the relation between stopping potential and the threshold frequency.It said only increasing the intensity could overcome the stopping potential. Here came the second inconsistency of wave theory with the experimental results.
According to the wave theory, photoelectric effect was not aninstantaneous process, it was time taking. This was the third inconsistency with the experiments.
The above three inconsistencies showed that wave theory of light could not explain the experimentally observed characteristics of photoelectric effect.","Reasoning, Property, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"EINSTEIN’S PHOTOELECTRIC EQUATION:
Since wave theory could not explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein proposed a particle theory of light for the first time
He said that radiations are made up of specific and discrete packets of energy called as quanta of radiation energy. Each energy quantum has a value equal to hv, where h = Planck’s constant, and v = frequency of incident light
These specific packets of quanta of energy are known as photons
When a light of frequency(v) (having energyhv ) is incident on a metal surface of work function(Φo), 3 cases could be possible
Case-1-When (hv < Φo), i.e., energy of photon is less than the work function of metal , no photoelectric emission occurs
Case-2- When (hv = Φo), i.e., energy of photon is exactly same as the work function of metal, then electrons get enough energy to just escape the metal surface.
Case-3- When (hv > Φo),e., energy of photon is greater than the work function of metal. Then electron, apart from getting energy to escape the metal surface, the remaining energy is provided to the electron as kinetic energy. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
hv = Φo + Kmax

Here, Kmax is the maximum kinetic energy of a photoelectron

The above equation is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation
From the Einstein’s photoelectric equation, following points are clear:

Photoelectric current (i) is directly proportional to the intensity (I) of radiation. As the intensity rises, number of photons received by metal surface in a unit area per unit time rises, so number of electrons emitted rises, and hence, photoelectric current increases
                             I ∝ I
Since saturation current is just a maximum value of photoelectric current, saturation current gets higher with increasing intensity of incident light
For every metal, there exists a certain minimum frequency below which no photoelectric effect occurs. This frequency is called threshold frequency.
                       HVO = ΦO
Here, vo = frequency of incident light, Φo = work function of metal

Stopping potential (Vo) and Maximum kinetic energy (Kmax) doesn’t depend upon the intensity. Because intensity is the number of photons in unit area and unit time, and the photoelectric effect take place when one electron takes one photon
Stopping potential (Vo) and Maximum kinetic energy (Kmax) is directly proportional to the frequency (ν)
                        KMAX∝ V   VO∝ V
The relation between stopping potential, maximum kinetic energy and the frequency of incident light could be expressed mathematically as follows: using Einstein’s photoelectric equation

hv = Φo + Kmax

Kmax = hν - Φo

Also, Kmax = eVo

∴ eVo = hν - Φo

On rearranging the above equation:

Vo = (h/e)v + (Φo/e)
Photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process, meaning that there is no time gap between incident radiation and electron emission.","Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning, Definition",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"PHOTON PICTURE OF RADIATION:
Radiation can behave as a wave as well as a particle under different situations. And while interacting with matter, it behaves as a particle
Energy (E) of a photon is given by: E = hv = hc/λ
Here, v = frequency, λ = wavelength, c = speed of light, and h = Planck’s constant

Momentum (p) of a photon is given by: p = hv/c = h/λ
Here symbols have their usual meaning.

Photons of similar frequencies possess equal energies and equal momentums
Photons are electrically neutral (not having a net positive or negative charge)
In a photon-particle collision:
Total energy remains constant
Total momentum remains constant
Total number of photons may or may not be constant.
The photoelectric effect proves the particle nature of radiation. Whereas, the phenomena like interference, diffraction, and polarization proves the wave nature of light. Hence, we can say that radiation displays both, wave nature, and particle nature, meaning a radiation possesses wave-particle dualism.","Reasoning, Property, Relation, Formula, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"WAVE NATURE OF MATTER: DE BROGLIE’S HYPOTHESIS:
De Broglie proposed that if the radiations could possess dual nature, matters could also possess dual nature.
A particle of mass (m), moving with velocity (v) could behave like a wave under suitable conditions. And the corresponding wave related to that matter is called matter wave
De Broglie’s wavelength for matter wave is given by: λ = h/p

If we take an example of a car of mass= 900kg, moving with the velocity of 36km/hr (10m/s).

The wavelength associated with the car will be:





We can observe that the wavelength associated with the car is insignificant and can’t be detected experimentally.

Hence, for the macroscopic objects, the mass is so large that the matter wave associated with them becomes insignificant and negligible

Case-2- (Microscopic object)

If we take an electron, mass=9.1 X 10-31 kg, moving with the speed of light (3 X 108 m/s).

"HEISENBERG’S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE:
This principle was in favor of the wave nature of matter
It stated that it is impossible to simultaneously evaluate the precise position and momentum of particle. There is always some probability in predicting the position and momentum of a particle. Mathematically, it can be written as:
                   (Δx)(Δp) ≥ h/(2π)

 

Considering the above equation, 2 cases are possible:

Case-1- If precise momentum(p) of an electron is known, then its wavelength by De Broglie’s hypothesis will be constant:
              λ = h/p

It means that the wavelength has a fixed value and the wave is extended infinitely throughout the wave. Hence, it is impossible to find the position of the wave.

Mathematically, if   p = fixed  , Then, Δp→0, Δx→∞



Case-2- If the wave is localized, having finite end points
A localized wave is shown below:



As we can see in the diagram, the wavelength (λ) is not fixed, so the momentum (p) is also not fixed.

Hence, there is uncertainty in both, momentum (p) and position (x).","Definition, Formula, Relation, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data

The pattern of deflected electrons was quite similar to the diffraction pattern of waves
The wavelength corresponding to the electron (matter wave) was found to be λ = 0.165nm
The experiment was in strong agreement with De Broglie’s hypothesis
According to De Broglie’s hypothesis, matter wave is given by:

 

The experiment proved that electrons behave as a wave under specific conditions as the scattering of electron gave rise to the diffraction pattern
On putting the value of V= 55V (the value at which a strong peak was detected), we get



The wavelength calculated above using De Broglie’s hypothesis is equal to the wavelength observed in the Davisson and Germer experiment. So, Davisson and Germer experiment was consistent with De Broglie’s hypothesis.

Geiger and Marsden carried out few experiments on the advice of Rutherford
On a very thin gold foil, highly energetic ray of α-particles(that are positively charged with energy of 5.5MeV)was incident
Scattered α-particles when strike zinc sulphide screen(surrounding the thin gold foil) produced light flashes(scintillations) which were observed via detector(microscope)

Scattered α-particles’ distribution as a function of scattering angle(θ) was analyzed and plotted as a graph
 

As the scattering angle(θ) got higher, count of scattered α-particles observed got lower, and vice versa
Almost all of the α-particles passed through the gold foil undeflected, and infinitesimally small number of α-particles got deflected
This proved that almost all the space in an atom is empty (9999999999996%), and the positive charge is confined to an extremely small region because very few of the positively charged α-particles were repelled by gold foil proving positive charge is confined to a small region. This region was called nucleus.
Atom has a structure analogous to our solar system where nucleus (like sun) is at center and all the electrons (like planets) revolving around it in a specified circular path at large speeds

Electrons and protons are bound together by electrostatic forces of attraction and atom, as a whole is electrically neutral

Accelerated charged particle produces electromagnetic waves (Maxwell Theory), so orbital radius of electron should go on decreasing and finally electron should fall into the nucleus. But atoms are stable in nature and this stability of atoms could not be clarified by Rutherford’s model
The model didn’t talk about electronic structure of atoms, viz. electrons orientation, their orbital motion and relative energy of electron in different orbits
Dual character of electromagnetic radiation couldn’t be elaborated by the model","Property, Relation, Formula, Definition",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"ATOMIC SPECTRA:
When an electron jumps amongst energy levels in an atom, energy is emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiations and these radiations produce a spectral lines of frequencies(or wavelength) associated with an atom, called atomic spectra
Spectroscopy is the learning and examination emission and absorption spectra associated with an atom to determine its properties
Spectral lines are the bright and dark line series that constitute the spectrum associated with an atom
An atom has a discrete spectra(where exist a fixed specific lines of energy transition of electron with discrete energy gaps) also known as quantized spectra
Another type is continuous spectra(where there is no specific lines of energy transition of electrons) which is the reverse of discrete spectra
  

There are 3 types of atomic spectra: a)emission spectra, b)absorption spectra, c) continuous spectra
Emission spectra:

Radiation spectrum produced due to absorption of energy by a matter
When an electron of an atom, molecules or ions get to a higher energy state than their ground (stable) state due to radiation absorption, they are said to be excited
Emission spectrum is produced when energy is supplied to a sample (through heating or irradiation) and the wavelength or frequency of radiation emitted by the sample is observed as a function of energy
Absorption spectra:

It is just the opposite of emission spectra
Continuous radiation (energy) is directed through a sample which absorbs certain radiation of particular wavelengths and the remaining spectrum is recorded. Absorbed wavelengths correspond to the dark spaces in the spectrum
Whatever absent(showed by dark lines) in the emission spectrum of an atom is actually present (showed by bright lines) in the absorption spectrum of that atom
Continuous spectra:

Formed when a ray of white light is passed through a prism(or water droplets) causing a continuous spectrum of visible light of different wavelength
There are no discrete lines (separation) between any 2 adjacent wavelengths
Speed of light changes with respect to the medium through which it passes, so as the medium changes, light with the longest wavelength (red)deviates the least and the light with the shortest wavelength (violet) deviates the most","Definition, Property, Types",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"SPECTRAL SERIES:
On passing electric discharge through hydrogen gas, hydrogen molecules would dissociate giving rise to excited (highly energetic) hydrogen atoms that emit radiation of certain specified frequency while returning to its ground state

Here R= Rhydberg constant = 109677cm-1(found experimentally), n= 3, 4, 5…… (higher discrete energy state from which electron jumps to 2nd energy state thus emitting radiation)
         λ = wavelength of emitted radiation in (cm)

For maximum wavelength(λmax) in the Balmer series, =3 (has to be minimum):
For minimum wavelength (λmin) in the Balmer series, n=∞(has to be minimum):
Lyman Series:

Spectral series when radiation emitted is due to jumping of electron from higher energy states to ground state
Mathematically expressed as


Here n= 2, 3, 4…
For maximum wavelength  in the Lyman series, n=2 (has to be minimum):
λmax = 4/3R

For minimum wavelength in the Lyman series, n=∞(has to be minimum):

Atomic spectra has a huge scope in the study of electronic structures of various atoms, molecules and ions
Elements have their own distinctive spectral series. So spectral series is used in the identification (even discovery) of unknown atoms

"BOHR’S MODEL OF HYDROGEN ATOM:
Drawbacks of Rutherford’s atomic model lead to the Bohr’s Model where he came up with 3 postulates:
First Postulate:Atoms have some specific stable energy states(called stationary states) where electrons could orbit around the nucleus without emitting radiation
Second Postulate: Orbiting of electrons occur only in the orbits (called stable orbits) where electrons’ angular momentum(L) is equal to the integral multiples ofh/(2π), leading to the quantization of moving electron
          LN =MVNRN = NH/(2Π)

Ln= angular momentum of electron in nth orbit

vn= velocity of electron in nth orbit

rn= radius of nth orbit

n= permitted orbits on which electron revolve (called principle quantum number)

Third Postulate: Electron while jumping from higher(initial) energy state to lower(final) energy state, emit a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the 2 energy states, and its frequency is given by:
hv = Ei - Ef
Bohr’s Radius: The radius on which electron move around the nucleus in the orbit described by the Bohr’s model is known as Bohr’s radius.

Using the second postulate and Rutherford’s model(eq.1)

"Composition of Nucleus

Nucleus consists of protons and neutrons.
Protons are positively charged particles which are present inside the nucleus and neutrons are neutral as they don’t have any charge.
Atomic number: -
Atomic number constitutes the total number of protons which are present in the nucleus of that atom.
It is denoted by ‘Z’.
Atomic mass:-
Atomic mass is the total number of neutrons and protons which are present inside the nucleus.
Mass of electrons is not considered while calculating the mass of the atom and only the mass of neutrons and protons are considered;
Since the electrons are the lightest particles their mass is not considered.
It is also known as Mass Number.
It is denoted by ‘A’.

"Nuclei types

Isotopes: - Two nuclei with the same atomic number and different mass number are isotopes of each other.

Charge on the nucleus is such that the entire atom is electrically neutral as a whole.
Atom constitutes of electrons,protons and neutrons.
Consider an element ZX
Where Z= atomic number, (the number of protons =Z and the number of electrons =Z).

"Size of Nucleus

Rutherford performed an experiment which proved that the size of the nucleus is extremely small.
In Rutherford scattering experiment a beam of alpha particles were made to pass through a small thin gold foil.
Very few alpha particles were deflected.
The alpha particles got deflected because of repulsion with the nucleus as alpha particles are positively charged.They get repelled because they are both positively charged.
Very small number of alpha particles got deflected proving that nucleus is very small in size.
It was found that the radius of a nucleus(R) of mass number A is given as :-
R=R0A1/3 where A = mass number and R0=constant.
Volume of a nucleus is ∝to the mass number.
V =(4/3)πR3 , Also R ∝(A)1/3

This relation helps in understanding nuclear masses and interaction of nuclei with each other.","Relation, Property, Formula",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Nuclear binding energy

Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to hold an atom’s protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
Energy required holding neutrons and protons together therefore keeps the nucleus intact.
It can also be defined as the energy needed to separate the nucleons from each other.
 

Importance of nuclear binding energy describes how strongly nucleons are bound to each other. By determining its value we will come to know whether the neutrons and protons are tightly or loosely bound to each other.
If nuclear binding energy is high -> high amount of energy is needed to separate the nucleons this means nucleus is very stable.
If nuclear binding energy is low -> low amount of energy is needed to separate the nucleons this means nucleus is not very stable.
Mass defect:-
Mass defect is the difference in the mass of nucleus and its constituents(neutrons and protons).
It is denoted by ΔM.
Mathematically :- ΔM = [Z mp+ (A-Z) mn]- M
Where mp=mass of 1 proton, Z=number of protons,(A-Z)= mass of neutrons, mN = mass of 1 neutronand M =nuclearmass of the atom.
For example: -(168O)àOxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons.
Mass of 8 protons à (8x1.00866) u and Mass of 8 neutrons à(8x1.00727) u.
Therefore Oxygen nucleus à(8p+8n) à8(1.00866 + 1.00727) = 16.12744u.
From spectroscopy ->Atomic mass of (168O) =15.9949u.
Mass of 8 electrons =(8x0.00055) u.
Therefore Nuclear mass of (168O) = (15.9949 – (8x0.00055)) =15.99053u.
Nuclear mass is less than sum of the masses of its constituents.
This difference in mass is known as mass defect.
It is also known as excess mass.","Definition, Property, Relation, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Relation between Mass defect and Nuclear binding energy:-
Nuclear binding energy is denoted by Eb.
Eb= ΔMc2
Where Eb = nuclear binding energy, ΔM=mass defect.

"Nuclear binding energy per nucleon

Nuclear binding energy per nucleon is defined as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual constituents.
It is denoted by Ebn.
Experimentally there was a graph plotted between binding energy per nucleon and the mass number(A).
 

Following are the observations from the graph:-
Initially the graph was increasing.This implies that Ebn is very less for lesser mass number.
In the middle range the Ebn becomes constant.This means Ebn is independent of mass number.
In the end Ebn starts decreasing.This shows Ebn is less when mass number is more.","Definition, Property, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Deriving Nuclear force from Ebn

Lighter nuclei: -
In the initial part of the graph A(mass number) is less therefore Ebn is also less.As a result lesser energy is required to separate the nucleons.
This shows nuclei are unstable.
The nuclei are unstable and in order to become stable lighter nuclei combine with each other to form heavier nuclei.
Let the energy of heavier nuclei formed is E’bn and of lighter nuclei be Ebn. This implies E’bn> Ebn.
Energy is released when 2 lighter nuclei combine together to form a heavier nuclei.
This process is known as Nuclear Fusion.
For heavier nuclei:-
Mass number is very high and Ebn is very less.
In order to become stable the heavier nuclei will split into 2 lighter nuclei.
Energy associated with heavier nuclei =Ebn and energy associated with 2 lighter nuclei =E’bn.
This implies E’bn> Ebn. Energy is released in this process by the heavier nuclei in order to attain stability.
This process is known as Nuclear Fission.
Constancy of Ebnin the mid-range of A:-
In this portion the mass number is increasing due to whichnumber of nucleons also increase.
The force which is present between the nucleons is of short range.The strength of the force decreases as the distance increases.
The nucleons are getting affected by their nearest neighbouring nucleons and not by the nucleons which are far away.
As a result Ebn remains constant.
But when there are too many nucleons Ebn suddenly starts decreasing.","Property, Relation, Definition, Effects",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Nuclear force

The force with which the nucleons are bound together is known as nuclear force.
It is the strong attractive force that binds the nucleons together.
When the nuclear force is compared to other forces of nature like gravitational or coulomb’s force etc.it is the strongest of all the forces.
As protons are positively charged they repel each other.This force of repulsion is given by Coulomb’s force of repulsion.
This nuclear force is stronger than the coulomb’s force so it overcomes the force of repulsion.
This is the reason neutrons and protons are held together inside the nucleus.
It is independent of electric charge.Magnitude of nuclear force is same between proton-proton,proton-neutron or neutron-neutron.
Nuclear force cannot be given mathematically.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Radioactivity

Radioactivity is a nuclear phenomenon in which an unstable nucleus undergoes decay to form stable nuclei.
Radioactivity was discovered accidentally by a scientist Henry Becquerel (1896).
Henry Becquerel

 

Only those nuclei which are unstable will show the phenomenon of radioactivity.
Fluorescence is a property shown by fluorescent objects; when visible light falls on a fluorescent object then these objects will also start emitting light.
Henry Becquerel performed experiments on some fluorescent objectsand he gave a hypothesis that fluorescent objects along with the visible light also emit some kind of radiation as well.
Experimental set-up:-
He took a photographic plate and placed inside a box.He placed a fluorescent object on the top of the box and allowed the sun light to fall on it.
As the box is opaque it won’t allow the rays of light to pass through it.
When the photographic plate will be developed there should be no traces of image on the plate.
He repeated the experiment by taking different compounds and observed there was no image formed on the photographic film.
This showed that sunlight is the only ray which is emitted in the above case and as the plate was covered with opaque object so the sunlight is not able to reach the plate.
 

He then took the compound of uranium known as uranium potassium sulphate.
When the photographic plate was developed there was a black spot on the photographic plate.
This shows that some radiation was emitted that reached the photographic plate.
 

In order to know from where the radiation was emitted, he kept a blade on top of a box and uranium potassium sulphate compound was placed above the blade.
After performing the experiment, when the photographic plate was developed, the photo of blade was seen on the plate.
This shows that the radiation was emitted by the uranium potassium sulphate compound.
 

Accidentally while he was performing the experiment it was not sunny that day.
The result which he got was same i.e. when the photographic plate was developed there was the same image of the blade on the plate.
Conclusion:-

The radiation was emitted by the uranium potassium sulphate compound and sunlight did not play any role in emitting the radiations.
After series of experiments he proved that it was uranium alone which was responsible for emitting the radiations.
He concluded that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own.
This phenomenon was named as radioactivity.","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Radioactive nuclides: Nuclear stability

Experimentally it was observed that the number of neutrons varies with the number of protons as we move higher in the periodic table.
For the elements which have lesser atomic number (e.g.: O, C) the number of neutrons and the number of protons are equal.
From the graph we can see the straight line shows the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons.
But as the atomic number increases gradually the number of neutrons become more than the number of protons.
In the graph there is a specific pattern like zigzag is shown bythe stable nuclides and some which don’t show this pattern represents the unstable nuclides.
The nuclides which are unstable emit some radiations to become;this phenomenon is known as radioactivity and the nuclides are known as radioactive nuclides.
Nuclides to the left of the graph arestablewhich shows they have excess neutrons.
Nuclides to the right of the graph have excess protons.Such nuclides are known as radioactive nuclides.","Property, Relation, Definition",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Radioactive Decay

Radioactive decay is a phenomenon in which unstable nucleus decay to form stable nuclei.
There are 3 types of radioactive decay by which a unstable nuclei becomes stable nuclei:-
Alpha decay:-
In alpha decay α - particle (helium nucleus) is emitted.
Beta decay:-
In beta decay electrons or positrons are emitted.
If electronsare emitted then it is known as β- decay; and when positronsare emitted then the decay is known as β+
Gamma decay:-
In gamma decay high energy photons(γ rays) are emitted.
Law of radioactive decay:
Law of radioactive decay states that the number of nuclei undergoing decay per unit time is ∝to total number of nuclei in the sample.
Consider a sample of radioactive nuclei (Uranium). Thesample of uranium will have several uranium nuclei and they will undergo radioactive decay to convert into relatively stable lighter nuclei.
That means the number of uranium nuclei will gradually keep on decreasing with time.
For example:-
If in a sample there are 10 uranium nuclei and in another 100 uranium nuclei the rate of decay will be slower where there are 10 uranium nuclei as compared to 100 uranium nuclei.
Generalized expression for law of radioactive decay:-

Suppose there are ‘N’ active nuclei at any instant of time (‘t’).

In small interval of time ‘dt’ =’dN’ (number of nuclei decay).

Rate of decay (dN/dt) ∝N (number of nuclei which are present in the sample).

(dN/dt) = -(λ N)

Whereλ = decay constant and (-ive) sign means the number of nuclei is gradually decreasing with time.
=> (dN) =-λ dt, integrating both the sides,
=>N0N∫(dN)/N = -λ0t∫ N dt
Where N0=number of nuclei at t=0 and N= number of nuclei after time t.
[ln N]N0N = -λ[t]0t
(ln N0 – ln N) =-λt
=>ln(N/N0) = -λt
=> (N/N0)=e- λt
=>N = N0 e-λt always N0> N.
Radioactive law is also known as exponential decay law as number of nuclei decreases exponentially which can be seen from the graph if plotted between N and t.
It is followed only by radioactive nuclei.","Definition, Property, Types, Formula, Relation, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Terminologies related to Radioactive decay

Decay Rate: -
Decay rate is defined as the number of nuclei decaying per unit time.
Denoted by ‘R’.
Mathematically:- R =-(dN/dt)
Where dN=change in the number of nuclei with time and (-ive) sign shows the number of nuclei decreasing.
From Exponential decay law N = N0 e-λt, therefore
R=(d/dt)( N0 e-λt)
=- N0 [e-λt(-λ)]
R= N0λ e-λt ;
At t=0 , R0= N0λ (equation (1))
Therefore R=R0 e-λt=>decay constant also changes exponentially.
Activity of radioactive sample:-
Activity of radioactive sample is defined as the total decay rate R of a sample of one or more radionuclides.
Decay rate of whole sample is considered.
I. unit: - Becquerel(Bq); 1Bq = (1 decay/sec).
Other unit: - Curie(Ci); 1C i=3.7 x1010
Half-life of radioactive sample:-
Half – life of radioactive sample is defined as the time at which number of nuclei reduces to one-half of their initial values.
It is denoted by t (1/2).
Half-life tells how long radioactive nuclei can last.
Mathematical expression:-
From radioactive law , N=N0e-λt (equation(1))
Initially number of sample = N0.
Later number of samples will become=(N0/2).
Therefore from equation(1)- (N0/2) =N0e-λt(1/2)
=>e-λt(1/2)= (1/2)
=>- λt(1/2) = ln(1/2) (taking log on both sides)
=>- λt(1/2) =ln(1) – ln(2)
=>λt (1/2) = ln(2) (using ln (1) =0).
=>t(1/2) = (0.693/λ)
Mean-life of radioactive sample:-
Mean life is defined as the average life of a nuclei in the radioactive sample.
Any nuclei can decay at any interval of time.
It is denoted by tav.
Mathematically:-
Let number of radioactive sample at t=0 =N0.
From the law of radioactive decay (dN/dt) =-λN
=> dN= -λNdt (these many nuclei will decay in time dt).
Therefore number of nuclei which decay between t and (t+dt) =λNdt.
But of the nuclei will decay fast and some will slowly decay.
Sum of lives of all these nuclei = tλNdt.
Therefore average life of the sample =tav= (0∞∫(tλN)dt/N0)
= (λ/N0) 0∞∫ (tN) dt.
From exponential law of decay :- N =N0 e-λt
tav= (λ/N0) ∫tN0 e-λt dt = (λ/N0)∫t e-λt dt
tav = λ0∞∫te-λtdt
=λ[t∫e-λt dt -∫(∫e-λt.1)dt
=λ[(te-λt)/(-λ)]0∞ -λ [(e-λt)/(-λ) dt]0∞
=λ[0] –λ[(e-λt)/λ2]0∞
tav = (1/ λ)
Using t(1/2) = (0.693/λ)  and tav = (1/ λ)
tav = (t(1/2)/0.693)","Definition, Formula, Relation, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data

(Uranium (U) is known as parent nucleus and Thorium (Th) is known as daughter nucleus).
24He is α particle.

Q-value of alpha decay

Q-value is a parameter or a characteristic of a nuclear reaction which describes whether the reaction can take place or not.
Q-value is defined as difference in the initial mass energy and final mass energy of decayed products.
Consider the general equation:-
AZX (parent) -->(A-4) (Z-2) Y + 24
Initial rest mass energy Ui =[m (AZX) - Zme]c2
Where m (AZX) = rest mass and Zme = mass of electrons.
Final rest mass energy Uf = [m((A-4) (Z-2) Y – (Z-2) me + m(24He) – 2me ] c2
Q =Ui - Uf
=[m (AZX) - Zme - m((A-4) (Z-2) Y + (Z-2) me - m(24He) + 2me]c2
Q = [m (AZX) - m((A-4) (Z-2) Y- m(24He)]c2
If Q =(+ive) then equation is energetically allowed.
=> Q>0, (Ui-Uf) >0=> Ui>Uf
This implies energy of the reactants is more than the energy of the products.
There is some free energy that is in the form of kinetic energy.
If Q =(-ive) then equation is not energetically allowed.","Definition, Property, Relation, Formula",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Beta decay

In case of beta decay either electron or positron is emitted.
Mass number remains the same.
β−decay --> Electron is emitted.
Atomic number increases by 1.
For example:- 3215P à1632S + e- + ̅ν  where  ̅ν =anti-neutrino
Q-value for β−decay:-
AZXàA (Z+1) Y + e-+ ̅ν
Initial rest mass energy Ui = [m (AZX) - Zme]c2
Where m (AZX) = rest mass and Zme = mass of electrons
Final rest mass energy Uf = [m(A (Z+1) Y) – (Z+1) me + me ] c2
=[m(A (Z+1) Y) -Zme] c2
Therefore Q =Ui– Uf
=[m(AZX) -Zme – m(A (Z+1) Y) + Zme] c2
Q = [m(AZX) - m(A (Z+1) Y)]
Example:-

β+decay à Positron(same as electron but with (+ ive) charge) is emitted.
Atomic number decreases by 1.
For example:- 2311Na -->1022Ne + e++ν where ν = neutrino
Q-value for beta (+ive) decay:-
AZX -->A (Z-1) Y + e+ + ν
Initial rest mass energy Ui = [m (AZX) - Zme]c2
Where m (AZX) = rest mass and Zme = mass of electrons
Final rest mass energy Uf = [m(A (Z-1) Y) – (Z-1) me + me ] c2
Therefore Q =Ui - Uf
= [m (AZX) - Zme - m(A (Z-1) Y) – (Z-1)me - me] c2
Q = [m(AZX) - m(A (Z-1) Y) -2 me] c2
Example to show whether nuclear reaction can take place or not:-
11p(proton) à01n(neutron) + e+ + ν. The mass of neutron is greater than the mass of proton.
The Q-value = (-ive) as a result the above reaction is not possible.This means conversion of stable proton to neutron is not allowed.
Consider 01n (neutron) à11p (proton) + e- + ̅ν
The Q-value =(+ive) as a result above reaction is possible.This means conversion of neutron to proton is allowed.

"Types of Nuclear Fission reactions:

Uncontrolled chain reaction:-
In uncontrolled chain reaction, the reaction is uncontrolled and rapid.The reaction keeps increasing and becomes huge.
Energy of the order of mega electron volts is produced.
This reaction is known as chain reaction as the product formed in first reaction initiates the second reaction and so on.
One of the important applications of this reaction is in making atom bombs,hydrogen bombs and nuclear bombs.
(Number of neutrons hitting next target)/ (number of neutrons emitted)>=1.

"Nuclear Reactor

Nuclear reactors are useful in producing electricity.
A nuclear reactor is an arrangement to generate electricity which makes use of nuclear fission.
Requirements for controlled nuclear fission in reactor:

Neutrons to be slowed down.
Neutrons are slowed down by using moderators which are lighter nuclei which slow down fast moving neutrons by elastic collision.
Commonly used moderators:-
1.Water

Heavy Water
Graphite
Consequence of use of moderators:-
Multiplication factor of neutrons increases: - When a neutron hits a target nucleus along with daughter nucleus,it produces 3 neutrons.These 3 neutrons are highly energetic but they need to be slowed down, so they can hit the target nucleus.
As a result high multiplication factor results in uncontrolled chain reaction.
 

Excess neutrons to be absorbed.
As uncontrolled chain reaction is wanted therefore to absorb excess neutrons Control Rods are used.
These control rods are inserted in the core of the nuclear reactor.
Control rods are capable of initiating(while taking out of the reactor) and stopping(inserting in the nuclear reactor) the nuclear reaction.
As they absorb all the excess neutronsthere are no neutrons left to start the reaction.
Control rods are made up of neutron absorbing materials.
They decrease the multiplication factor of neutrons to a very small value.
Commonly used material is Cadmium.
Control Rods

 

Construction of Nuclear Reactor

The core of the nuclear reactor consists of uranium (235U) in the form of cylindrical rods.These rods are dipped inside a liquid which is the moderator.
Whenever one neutron strikes this uranium rod nuclear fission reaction starts and 3 fast moving neutrons are produced.
Because of the moderator these 3 neutrons undergo elastic collision as a result they slow down before they strike the second rod.
Geometry of the core is such that only one out of 3 neutrons which are emitted strike the next rod making the reaction a controlled one.
When the control rods are inserted inside they will absorb all the extra neutrons.Since there are no neutrons nuclear fission reaction will stop.
Large amount of energy is also released in the core.
In order to extract the energy from the core water at very high pressure is passed through it.
As hot water passes through it produces steam in the steam generators.
This steam is used to run the turbines which in turn produce electricity.
This process will keep on continuing till the uranium on the rods does not get over.Then the rods have to be replaced in the nuclear reactor.

Needs fuel in extremely small quantity.

Spent fuel is highly radioactive and extremely hazardous to all life forms.

Step3:- 21H(deuteron)+ 11H(proton) -->32He(helium) + γ(Gamma rays)+5.49MeV
Step4:- 32H + 32H -->42He + 11H+11H+12.86MeV
Step 1,2,and 3 occur twice in the sun and the step 4 occurs only once.

Application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted of photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is available from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with α-particles.

"Binding Energy Curve and its Features

Binding energy per nucleon as the average energy per nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.

Binding energy curve is a plot of the binding energy per nucleon versus the mass number for large nuclei.",Definition,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"The main features of his curve are give below:

(i) The binding energy per nucleon (Ebn) is practically constant, i.e. practically independent of the atomic number for nuclei of middle mass number ( 30 < A < 170). The curve has a maximum of about 8.75 MeV for A = 56 and has a value of 7.6 MeV for A = 238.

(ii) Binding energy per nucleon is lower for both light nuclei (A<30) and heavy nuclei (A>170).

From above two observations we can draw the conclusions given below:

(a) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding energy of a few MeV per nucleon.

(b) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a consequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged.

(c)A very heavy nucleus, say A = 240, has lower binding energy per nucleon compared to that of a nucleus with A = 120. Thus if a nucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more tightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process.

(d) Consider two very light nuclei (A ≤ 10) joining to form a heavier nucleus. The binding energy per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei is more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei. This means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial system. Again energy would be released in such a process of fusion. This is the energy source of the sun.","Property, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Nuclear Force

Previously, we have studied that for average mass nuclei the binding energy per nucleon is approximately 8 MeV, which is much larger than the binding energy in atoms.

Therefore, to bind a nucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally different kind.

This force is nuclear force (strongest force in nature). It is strong enough to overcome the repulsion between the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and neutrons into the tiny nuclear volume.

Some important features of the nuclear binding force are given below:

(i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force acting between charges or the gravitational forces between masses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over the Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the nucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is much stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational force is much weaker than even Coulomb force.
(ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to zero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This leads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized nucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the binding energy per nucleon. A rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons as a function of distance is shown in the figure given below. The potential energy is a minimum at a distance r of about 0.8 fm. This means that the force is attractive for distances larger than 0.8 fm and repulsive if they are separated by distances less than 0.8 fm.
(iii) The nuclear force between neutron-neutron, proton-neutron and proton-proton is approximately the same. The nuclear force does not depend on the electric charge.","Property, Reasoning, Definition, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Introduction

We know that earlier electronic devices were made up of vacuum tubes or valves



Vacuum tubes or Valves:

The evolution of vacuum tubes started with diode and proceeded to triode, tetrode and pentode
Valves control the flow of electrons; In diodes, there were two electrodes – cathode and anode
Similarly, triode had three electrodes – cathode, grid and anode; tetrode had four electrodes – anode, two grids and cathode; pentode had five electrodes –anode, three grids and cathode
Generally in vacuum tubes, the electrons are produced by heating the cathode using low tension battery; The vacuum helps in electron not losing its energy by collision with air molecules in the way
However, the vacuum tube devices had some disadvantages and they are
Bulky
Operate at high voltages
Consume more power
Have limited life
Low reliability
  Diodes and transistors

Next came the discovery of semiconductor junction, namely, junction diode and transistors
These replaced the vacuum tubes or valves


The advantages of semiconductor devices are
Small in size
Operate at low voltages
Consume small power
Long life
High reliability
Though the above advantages are present, the circuits consisting of transistors were still bulky, less shock proof
Hence, it led to the discovery of integrated circuits which is a major revolution in the electronic industry
Example – The earlier generation television and computer monitors were very bulky as they were based on the principle of vacuum tubes; now days, we have LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors which support solid state electronics","Property, Reasoning, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data

Inorganic semiconductors like CdS, GaAs etc

"Band theory of solids

In a substance, as many atoms are close to each other, the energy levels of the atom form a continuous band, where in the electrons move.  This is called band theory of solids.

We know that in an atom, the protons and the neutrons constitute the central part called the nucleus
The electrons revolve around the nucleus in defined orbits
The orbits are named as 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d etc. each of which has a discrete energy level
All electrons in the same orbit have the same energy
The electrons in the innermost orbits which are completely filled constitute the valence electrons whereas the electrons in the outermost orbit which do not completely fill that shell are called conduction electrons
As seen in the diagram below, both Si and Ge have 4 electrons in the outermost shell


When in the crystal, the atoms are close to each other and hence they may be flow of electrons from one atom to another in the conduction band
Let us discuss in detail by considering interatomic distance in the X-axis and energy in the Y-axis:
As seen in the diagram below, the graph is divided into 4 regions – Region A, B, C and D
In the region A, the interatomic distance is large between atoms and in region D, the interatomic distance is small
 

       Region A

Consider that the Si or Ge crystal contains N atoms. Electrons of each atom will have discrete energies in different orbits
If the atoms are isolated, that is, separated from each other by a large distance, the electron energy will be the same
However, in a crystal, the atoms are close to each other separated by a distance of 2-3 Ao. Hence, electrons interact with each other and also with the neighbouring atoms
The overlap or the interaction will be felt more by the electrons in the outermost orbit while the inner electron energies will remain unaffected
Hence, in the case of Si and Ge crystals, we need to consider the changes in energies of electron in the outer most orbit only
For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3) while for Ge, the outermost orbit is fourth orbit (n = 4)
The number of electrons in both cases is 4 – namely 2s and 2p. Hence, the outer electrons in the crystal is 4
The maximum possible number of outer electrons in the orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons)
This is the case of well separated or isolated atoms as shown in region A
Region B

Suppose the atoms start coming nearer to each other to form a solid.
The energies of the electrons in the outermost orbit may increase or decrease, due to the interaction between electrons of different atoms
The 6N states for l=1, which originally had identical energies in the isolated atoms, spread out and form an energy band as shown in the region B
Similarly, the 2N states for l = 0 split into a second band separated from the first one
Region C

At still smaller spacing, however, there comes a region in which the bands merge with each other
The lowest energy state that is a split from the upper atomic level appears to drop below the upper state that has come from the lower atomic level
In this region, no energy gap exists where the upper and the lower energy states gets mixed
Region D

If the distance between the atom further decreases, the energy bands again split apart and are separated by an energy gap Eg
The total number of available energy states 8N has been re-apportioned between the two bands (4N states each in the lower and upper energy bands)
Here there are exactly as many states in the lower band (4N) as there are available valence electrons from the atoms (4N)
This lower band called the valence band is completely filled while the upper band is completely empty. The upper band is called the conduction band","Definition, Relation, Property, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Classification on the basis of energy bands

Depending upon the relative position of the valence band and the conduction band, the solids can be classified into conductors, insulators and semiconductors
Conductors

The conduction band and the valence band partly overlop each other and there is no forbidden energy band gap in between
The electrons from the valence band can easily move into the conduction band
Hence, large number of electrons are available for conduction
The resistance of such materials is low and conductivity is high


Insulators

In case of insulators, a large energy gap exists between the valence band and the conduction band
The energy gap is so high that the electrons from the valence band cannot move to the conduction band by thermal excitation
As there is no electrons in the conduction band, electrical conduction is not possible


Semiconductors

A finite but a small energy gap exists between the valence band and the conduction band
At room temperature, some of the electrons from the valence band acquire energy and move into the conduction band
Hence, at high temperature, semiconductors have conductivity and resistance is also not as high as insulators


Types of semiconductors

There are two types – Intrinsic semiconductor and Extrinsic semiconductor","Types, Definition, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Intrinsic semiconductor

A pure semiconductor, free from impurities is called intrinsic semiconductor
The electrical conductivity of pure semiconductor is called intrinsic conductivity
Structure – Consider pure Germanium and Silicon. Both have 4 valence electrons
Crystalline structure

At temperature 0K –

In the crystal structure, the four valence electron of the Ge atom forms four covalent bond by sharing of electron with the neighbouring atoms
Each covalent bond is made of two atoms, each one from each atom
By forming covalent bond, each Ge atom in the crystal behaves as if the outermost orbit of each atom is complete with 8 electrons, having no free electrons in the crystal
At room temperature

The conduction is possible if the electrons break away from the covalent bonds and are free by the thermal energy
When electron breaks away from the covalent bond, the empty space or vacancy left in the bond is called a hole
An electron from the neighbouring atom can break away and can be attracted by the hole, creating hole in the other place
In the crystal structure, thus, we can see, electrons break the covalent bond and keep moving. Similarly, due to attraction of hole and electron, hole also keeps moving in a crystal
Thus, breakage of a covalent bond produces one free electron and one hole in the crystal
In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of holes = number of electrons. Thus ne = nh = ni
Energy band theory

There is an energy gap of about 1 eV between the valence and the conduction band

At temperature 0K –

In terms of energy band theory, the valence band is full and the conduction band is totally empty
As no electrons are available for conduction, the Ge crystal behaves like a electrical insulator


At room temperature -

The thermal vibrations of the atoms provide energy to the electrons in the valence band to cross the energy gap and move into the conduction band as free electrons
This results in electrical conductivity of the semiconductor
As electrons move from the valence band to the conduction band, a vacancy is created in the valence band. This vacancy is called a hole
As electrons move in the conduction band, the holes move in the valence band and electrical conduction in semiconductors is possible


At a higher temperature, when electric field is applied, the holes move towards the negative potential, giving rise to hole current and electrons move towards the positive potential giving rise to electron current. Thus I = Ie + Ih","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Formula, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Extrinsic semiconductor

A doped semiconductor or a semiconductor with suitable impurity added to it is called extrinsic semiconductor
There are two types – n-type and p-type
In n-type semiconductor, the electrons are the majority carriers while the holes are the minority carriers
In p-type semiconductor, the holes are the majority carriers while the electrons are the minority carriers
A detailed study of n-type and p-type semiconductors, help us to understand better about the extrinsic semiconductor","Definition, Types, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"n-type semiconductor

When pure Si or Ge which has four valency electrons is doped with controlled amount of pentavalent atoms, like Arsenic, Phosphorus, Antimony or Bismuth, we get a n-type semiconductor
The four valence electron from the impure atom will combine with four electrons of the Si or Ge atom to form 4 covalent bonds
The fifth electron of the impure atom is free to move. Thus, each atom of the impure substance, donates a free electron for conduction. Hence, it is called as donor atom
Giving the free electron for conduction, the impure atom becomes positively charged, giving rise to a hole
Thus in n-type semiconductors, electrons are the majority carriers and holes are minority carriers
  

Energy band theory

Comparing Si or Ge doped with impurities like Arsenic with a pure Si or Ge,  the lowest energy level  of the conduction band  is less
The electrons occupy discrete energy levels called the donor energy level between the valence band and the conduction band
This donor energy level is below the bottom of the conduction band
Thus, very small energy supplied can excite the electron from the donor level to the conduction band, hence, conductivity of semiconductor becomes remarkably improved","Property, Reasoning, Examples, Definition",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"p-type semiconductor

When pure Si or Ge which has four valency electrons is doped with controlled amount of trivalent atoms, like Gallium, Indium, Boron or Aluminium, we get a p-type semiconductor
The three valence electron from the impure atom will combine with three electrons of the Si or Ge atom to form 3 covalent bonds
There will be one unbounded electron in the Ge atom which would try to form a covalent bond with the neighbouring Ge atom
This Ge-Ge covalent bond creates a deficiency of electron in Ge atom. Thus, creating a hole
This hole is compensated by the breakage of Ge-Ge covalent bond in the neighbourhood. Hence, electron moves towards the hole, resulting in hole formation at some other place
The trivalent atoms are called acceptor atoms and conduction of electricity is due to the motion of holes
Thus in p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are minority carriers


Energy band theory

Si or Ge doped with impurities like Aluminium, produces energy level which is situated in the energy gap slightly above the valence band
This is called as acceptor energy level
At room temperature, the electrons in the valence band can easily be transferred to the acceptor level. This produces a large number of holes in the valence band.
The valence band becomes the hole conducting band","Property, Reasoning, Examples, Definition",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"p-n junction formation

A p-n junction is the basic building block of many semiconductor devices like diodes, transistor etc.
 

Consider a thin p-type silicon semiconductor wafer. Convert a part of the p-type semiconductor into n-type silicon semiconductor by adding a small quantity of pentavalent impurity
The holes are the majority carriers in the p-type semiconductor and electrons are the majority carriers in the n-type semiconductor


In n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is more compared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more compared to the concentration of electrons
The first process that occurs in the p-n semiconductor is diffusion
In the formation of the p-n junction, due to the concentration gradient across the p and the n sides, the electrons diffuse from n region to p region and the holes diffuse from p region to n region


Diffusion current –
The motion of charge carriers due to the difference in concentration in two regions of the p-n junction, across the junction gives rise to diffusion current
As the diffusion continues, it leaves behind a positive charge on the n-side close to the junction. This positive charge, also called as ionised donor is immobile due to bonding with the surrounding atoms
Similarly, in the p-region, close to the junction, there is a negative charge or acceptor ions which are immobile
 

Depletion region formation –
The space charge region on both sides of the p-n junction has immobile ions and is also devoid of any charge carriers
This results in the formation of depletion region near the junction
Field setup –
The depletion region formation results in setting up a field at the junction
The field set up along the junction acts like a fictitious battery connected across the junction with positive terminal connected to the n-region


Barrier creation –
The electric field at the junction sets a barrier which opposes further diffusion of majority charge carriers through the junction
Thus, the barrier gets created at the junction prevents further diffusion
Width of the barrier – The physical distance from one side of the barrier to the other is called the width of the barrier
Height of the barrier –The difference in potential from one side of the barrier to the other side is known as the height of the barrier
Drift current
Due to the electric field developed at the junction, the electrons from the p-region move to the n-region. Similarly, the hole from the n-region move to the p-region. This results in drift current
The motion of charge carriers across the junction due to the electric field is called drift. This results in drift current
Drift current Vs Diffusion current
The drift current is in a direction opposite to that of the diffusion current
At a particular stage, the drift current becomes equal to the diffusion current
This stage is set to be equilibrium state when no current flows across the p-n junction
Potential barrier becomes maximum and is equal to VB
Thus, a p-n junction is formed. Thus, in a p-n junction under equilibrium there is no net current
The diagram below shows the p-n junction at equilibrium. . The n-material has lost some electrons and the p-material has acquired the electrons


Thus the n material is positive with respect to p material. The potential also prevents the movement of electron from the n-region to the p-region. This potential is called the barrier potential and is indicated as


When doping concentration is small, the electrons or holes move a large distance before collision with another electron or hole
Hence, the width of the p-n junction becomes large
As width of p-n junction increases, the electric field becomes small","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"p-n junction diode

A semiconductor diode is a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for the application of an external voltage
Thus p-n junction diode is a two terminal device represented as


The equilibrium potential barrier can be altered by applying an external voltage V across the diode
There are two methods of biasing a p-n unction – Forward bias and reverse bias","Definition, Property, Types",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Forward biasing

If the positive terminal of the external battery is connected to the p-side and the negative terminal of the external battery is connected to the n-side, then the p-n junction is said to be forward biased


The direction of the applied voltage V is in a direction opposite to that of the potential barrier setup at the junction


As a result of this, the depletion layer width decreases and the barrier height is reduced. The effective barrier height under forward bias is VB – V
If the applied voltage V is small, the barrier potential will be reduced only slightly below the equilibrium value. Hence, only small number carriers will possess energy to cross the junction. Thus, the current is small
If the applied voltage V is large, the barrier potential will be reduced significantly. Hence, the current is significant
Due to the applied voltage, the electrons from the n-side cross the depletion region and reach the p-side. Similarly, the holes from the p-side reach the n-side
As electrons reach the p-side and electrons are minority carriers in p-region, the forward bias is also known as minority carrier injection
At the junction, the minority carrier concentration increases significantly
Due to concentration gradient, the injected electrons on p-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end of the p-side
Similarly, the injected holes on the n-side diffuse from the junction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side
The motion of charged carriers on either side gives rise to current and is usually measured in mA
The total diode forward current is sum of hole diffusion current and conventional current due to electron diffusion","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Reverse biasing

If the positive terminal of the external battery is connected to the n-side and the negative terminal of the external battery is connected to the p-side, then the p-n junction is said to be reverse biased


The direction of the applied voltage is same as that of the barrier potential
As a result, the barrier height increases and the depletion region widens due to change in electric field
The effective barrier height is VB + V
This suppresses the flow of electrons from n region to p region and holes from the p region to n region. Hence, diffusion current decreases
The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on p-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the junction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This gives rise to drift current of order of few µA
The diode reverse current is not much dependent on the applied voltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers from one side of the junction to the other side of the junction
The current under reverse bias is essentially voltage independent up to a critical reverse bias voltage, known as breakdown voltage VBE
When V = VBE, the diode reverse current increases sharply. If the current is not limited, the p-n junction will get destroyed","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Characteristics of a p-n junction diode

There are two types of characteristics – Forward characteristics and Reverse characteristics



Forward characteristics

The graphical relationship between the forward bias voltage applied and the forward current through the p-n junction is called forward characteristics

We use a milliammeter in forward bias as the expected current is large
The current increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the voltage across the diode crosses certain value
After this voltage, the current increases exponentially, even for a very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the threshold voltage or cut-in voltage which is 0.2V for germanium diode and 0.7 for silicon diode
Reverse characteristics

The graphical relationship between the reverse bias voltage applied and the reverse current through the p-n junction is called reverse characteristics

In reverse bias, we use micro ammeter, as the current is very small
The current almost remains constant even if voltage is increased and it is called reverse saturation current","Types, Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Application of junction diode as a Rectifier

Rectifier is a device which is used for converting alternating current or voltage into direct current or voltage

During the negative half cycle of the input AC voltage, suppose P1 is positive and P2 is negative
On account of inductance, S1 becomes negative and S2 becomes positive
The p-n junction is reverse biased and hence the resistance of the p-n junction diode becomes high
Hence, no current flows in the circuit and we do not get any output across the load resistance RL

The filter circuit consists of Resistance and Capacitance

C has a high capacitance value and serves as a filter circuit
RL is a load resistance
Working:

The capacitance offers low impedance to AC component and offers infinite impedance to DC component
Due to this the AC component is bypassed or filtered out
The DC component produces a voltage drop across the load resistance which is almost DC voltage

"Special purpose p-n junction diode

Zener diode

It is a special purpose diode, named after the inventor C. Zener
It is designed to operate under reverse bias in the breakdown region
The symbol for Zener diode is
 

Fabrication – It has heavily doped p- side and n-side. Due to this, the depletion region formed is very thin about < 10-6. . Hence, the field at the junction is extremely high about -5 * 106 V/m for a small reverse bias voltage of 5 Volts
The high electric field strength is high enough to pull the valence electrons from the host atoms on the p-side which is accelerated to the n-side. This is known as ionisation
Characteristics – The Current – Voltage characteristics of Zener diode is shown below:
As seen from the graph, when the applied reverse bias voltage in Zener diode reaches the breakdown voltage Vz of the zener diode, there is a large change in current
The Zener voltage remains constant even though the current through the diode varies over wide range. This property of Zener diode is used for regulating the supply voltages so that they are constant
Zerner diode as a voltage regulator

                Why do we need to regulate voltage?

We know that the rectifier converts AC current into DC current.  When the AC input voltage of a rectifier fluctuates, the rectified output also fluctuates. Hence, to get a constant DC voltage from the DC unregulated output of the rectifier, we use Zener diode.

                Circuit Diagram:

The unregulated DC voltage from the output of the rectifier is connected to the Zener diode through a series resistance Rs such that the Zener diode is reverse biased
The output is measured across the load resistance RL


Working:

Case 1

When the input voltage increases, the current through Rs and Zener diode increases
This increases the voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the Zener diode
This is because in the breakdown region, the Zener voltage remains constant even though the current in the Zener diode changes
Case 2

Similarly, when the input voltage decreases, the current through Rs and hence Zener diode decreases
The voltage drop across Rs decreases without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode
Thus, the increase or decrease in the input voltage results in increase or decrease of voltage drop across Rs without any change in voltage across the Zener diode

This way, Zener diode behaves as a voltage regulator

Precautions

The zener diode must be reverse-biased
The zener diode must have voltage greater than zener break down voltage Vz
The zener diode is to be used in a circuit where the current is less than the maximum zener current Iz limited by power rating of the given zener diode","Definition, Property, Relation, Reasoning, Effects",Grade_12_Physics_Data

"Light emitting diode



Application – They convert electrical energy into light

It is a heavily doped p-n junction which under forward bias emits spontaneous radiation
The diode is encapsulated with a transparent cover so that the emitted light can come out
When the diode is forward biased, the electrons are sent from n layer to p layer and the holes are sent from p to n
Thus, at the boundary due to forward bias, the concentration of the minority carriers increases
The excess minority carriers recombine with the majority carriers, near the junction
On recombination, energy is released in the form of photons
Photons with energy equal to or slightly less than the band gap is emitted
When the forward current of the diode is small, the intensity of the light emitted is small
As the forward current increases, the intensity of light increases and reaches maximum.
Further increase in forward current, results in the decrease of light intensity
LEDs are thus biased in such a way such that the efficiency is maximum
The reverse breakdown voltage of LED is very small (say) 5V. Proper precaution should be taken such that high reverse voltage do not appear across them

Principle–These photo voltaic devices convert the optical radiation into electricity


Circuit

When solar light falls on a p-n junction, it generates emf
As the solar radiation is incident at the junction, the junction area is kept much larger for more power generation
A p Si layer of about 300 * 10-6m is taken. About this a still thin layer of about 0.3 * 10-6 m n Si layer is grown on one side by the process of diffusion
The other side of the p-layer is coated with a metal. This servers as a back contact
On the top of n Si layer, metallic grid is deposited. This is called front contact
The light is incident on the grid from the top
Working

The generation of emf by the solar cell, when light falls on, is due to the following three basic processes – (a) generation (b) separation and (c) collection
Generation
The generation of electron-hole paid due to light with energy hט> Eg close to the junction
Separation
The separation of electrons and holes due to the electric field of the depletion region
The electrons are swept to the n-side and the holes to the p-side
Collection
 

The electrons reaching the n-side are collected by the front contact and holes reaching the p-side are collected by the back contact
Thus, the p-side becomes positive and the n-side becomes negative giving rise to photo voltage
When external load is connected, a photo current IL flows through the load

"Transistor as a switch

Circuit Diagram

Let us consider n-p-n transistor which is of common emitter configuration


Working

Using Kirchhoff’s law for the above circuit,

For the input side,

-VBB +  IBRB + VBE  = 0

In other words, VBB  =   IBRB + VBE    ----------------------------------------------(1)

Similarly, in the case of output side,

-VCC + IcRc + VCE = 0

In other words, VCE=  VCC  -  IcRc ----------------------------------------------(2)

Assume VBB as the DC input voltage Vi and VCE as output voltage Vo

Hence (1) and (2) becomes,

Vi  =   IBRB + VBE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(3)

Vo=  VCC  -  IcRc------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(4)

Let us consider the change of Vo as Vi changes from 0 to higher value

Case 1 – When Vi < 0.6 V, there is no collector current. Hence, from (4), we get

Vo=  VCC 

The transistor is said to be in cut off state

Case 2 – When 0.6V <Vi <= 1.0 V, there will be some collector current.

 Hence, from (4), we get Ic increases. Hence, as Ic term is subtracted in (4) the value of Vo output voltage decreases.

In this range, as Ic increases almost linearly, so Vo decreases linearly. The transistor is said to be in active state at this stage

Case 3 –When Vi> 1.0 V, Vo is found to decrease towards zero but not zero. The collector current Ic becomes maximum and the transistor is in saturation state.

Graph

The relationship between Vi and Vo is called transfer characteristic curve of a base biased transistor in Common emitter configuration. The above mentioned regions – Cut off region, Active region and Saturation region are marked in the graph.

In cut-off state when Vi is low, the transistor is not working and hence said to be in switched off state.  In saturation state when Vi is high, the transistor is fully conducting as Ic is nearly equal to maximum or saturated. As the transistor is fully conducting, it is said to be in switched on state.

Thus the transistor acts as a switch.

When no AC signal voltage is applied to the input circuit, let the emitter current, base current and collector current be IE, IB and Ic
By applying Kirchhoff’s law, we know, IE = IB + Ic
From the output circuit, we find, VCC = VCE + Icily Hence, VCE = VCC - IcRL
Case 2 – When AC signal voltage is applied to the input circuit

There will be a change in the emitter-base voltage and hence the emitter current
As emitter current changes, collector current changes
In equation, VCE = VCC - IcRL as the collector current changes, the collector voltage VCE changes accordingly as VCC is fixed
The change in the collector voltage appears to be amplified output of the input variation

Here, the modulated signal now contains the message signal,

cm (t) = Ac sinωct + μAc sinωmt sinωct …(i)

Here μ = Am/Ac is the modulation index and μ ≤ 1. It should be kept less than 1 to avoid distortion.

We live in the world of information. Information needs to be communicated from one entity to another entity. This act of sending and receiving message from one place to another place, successfully, is called communication.

Quality in communication, which implies no addition, deletion or modification of the actual information
The growing needs of human beings in the field of communication imposed demands on

Complexity of information

"Evolution in communication

The table below shows us how physical messengers who travelled from one place to another changed to the current day situation where information comes to your doorstep anytime with easy access",Property,Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Communication System

The general form of communication system is depicted below:



As we see here, the basic elements of communication includes transmitter, Channel and the receiver.  The transmitter and the receiver may be located geographically at different places. The Channel connects the transmitter and the receiver.
Information Source – The source produces signal of the information which needs to be communicated.

Signal – Information in electrical form suitable for transmission is called signal.

Transmitter – Converts the source signal into suitable form for transmission through the channel.

Channel – The channel connecting the transmitter and the receiver is a physical medium. The channel can be in the form of wires, cables or wireless.

Noise – When the transmitted signal propagates along the channel, it may get distorted due to channel imperfection.

Thus, noise refers to unwanted signals that tend to disturb the process of communication from the transmitter to the receiver.

Receiver – Due to noise and other factors, the corrupted version of signal arrives at the receiver. The receiver has to reconstruct the signal into recognisable form of the original message for delivering it to the user. The signal at the receiver forms the output.","Definition, Property",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Modes of communication

Point to point communication – There is a single link between the transmitter and the receiver. Communication takes place between single transmitter and receiver

Example – Telephone



Broadcast mode – There are large number of receivers though information is sent by a single transmitter.

Example – Television and Radio","Types, Definition, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Communication – Terminology

Transducer – Any device which converts energy in one form to another form is called transducer.

Electrical transducer: A device that converts some physical variable like pressure, displacement, force, temperature, into corresponding variations in electrical signal. Hence, the output of this would be an electrical signal.

Signal Types – Information in electrical form suitable for transmission called signal, is of two types

Analog signal –

Continuous variations of voltage and current. Hence, single valued functions of time.
Sine wave is a fundamental analog signal
Example – Sound and picture signals in television


Digital signal –

Digital step value based
Binary system where 0 represents low level and 1 represents high level is used
Universal digital coding methods like BCD – Binary Coded Decimal and ASCII – American Standard Code of Information Interchange is used in common


Amplitude –

The maximum extent of vibration or oscillation from the position of equilibrium

 



Frequency –

The frequency is the number of waves which pass a fixed place in a given amount of time.



Phase –

The two waves depicted below have a phase difference indicated by the phase shift which is the fraction of the wave cycle which has elapsed relative to the origin.","Definition, Property, Examples",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Signal propagation – Terminology

Attenuation – The loss of strength of the signal while propagating through a medium is known as attenuation.

Amplification – The process of increasing the amplitude of the signal by using an electronic circuit is called amplification. This also increases the strength of the signal. Hence, it compensates the attenuation of the signal.

Range – It is the largest distance between the source and the destination upto which the signal is received with sufficient strength.

Bandwidth – It refers to the frequency range for which the equipment operates.

Modulation – If the information signal is of low frequency, it cannot be transmitted to long distances. Hence, at transmission point, it is super imposed on high frequency wave. This high frequency wave acts as a carrier of information. This is modulation

 

Sinusoidal wave modulation:

There are 3 types of modulation, namely 1. Amplitude modulation 2.Frequency modulation and 3. Phase modulation

Amplitude modulation –

The amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the information signal


Frequency modulation –

The frequency of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the information signal


Phase modulation –

The phase of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the information signal


Pulse wave modulation:



There are 3 types of pulse wave modulation – namely (a) Pulse amplitude modulation (b) Pulse width modulation (c) Pulse position modulation

Demodulation – The process of retrieval of information from the carrier wave at the receiver is termed as demodulation. This is a reverse of modulation.

Repeater – A repeater is a combination of receiver and a transmitter.

A repeater picks up the signal from the transmitter, amplifies and retransmits it to the receiver. Thus repeaters are used to extend the range of communication system

Example – Communication satellite is a repeater station in space.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Types",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Propagation of electromagnetic waves

While communication using radio waves, the transmitter antenna radiates electromagnetic waves. These waves travel through the space and reach the receiving antenna at the other end. We have considered below some of the wave propagation methods in brief.

Ground or Surface wave propagation:



In this mode of wave propagation, ground has a strong influence on propagation of signal waves from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. The signal wave glides over the surface of the earth
While propagating on the surface of the earth, the ground wave induces current in the ground. It also bends around the corner of the objects on the earth
Due to this, the energy of the ground wave is gradually absorbed by the earth and the power of the ground wave decreases
The power of the ground wave decreases with the increase in the distance from the transmitting station. This phenomenon of loss of power of the ground wave is called attenuation
The attenuation of ground waves increases very rapidly with the increase in its frequency
Thus, ground wave communication is not suited for high frequency signal wave and for very long range communication
To radiate signals with high efficiency, the antennas should have a size comparable to the wavelength of the signal
Sky waves:



The ionosphere plays a major role in sky wave propagation. We know that the earth’s atmosphere is divided into various regions like – Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere and Ionosphere.
The ionosphere is also called as thermosphere as temperature increases rapidly here and it is the outermost part of the earth’s atmosphere
Above troposphere, we have various layers like D (part of stratosphere), E (part of stratosphere), F1 (part of mesosphere), F2 (part of ionosphere)
The ionosphere is called so because of the presence of large number of ions or charged particles. Ionisation occurs due to the absorption of the ultraviolet and other high energy radiation coming from the sun, by the air molecues
The phenomenon of bending of electromagnetic waves in this layer so that they are diverted towards the earth is helpful in skywavepropogation. This is similar to total internal reflection in optics
The radiowaves of frequency range from 1710 kHz to 40 MHz are propagated in sky wave propagation
Space waves:



The space waves travel in straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.
Hence, space waves are used for line of sight communication such as television broadcast, microwave link and satellite communication
The line of sight communication is limited by (a) the line of sight distance (b) the curvature of the earth
At some point by the curvature of the earth, the line of sight propagation gets blocked.
The line of sight distance is the distance between transmitting antenna and receiving antenna at which they can see each other. It is also called range of communication dM
The range of space wave communication can be increased by increasing the heights of the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna.
The maximum line of sight distance (range of communication) dM between two transmitting anternna of height hT and the receiving antenna of height hR above the earth is given by
dM= (2RhT)1/2 + (2RhR)1/2","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Relation, Formula, Causes",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Modulation and its necessity



Any message signal, in general, is not a single frequency sinusoidal. But it spreads over a range of frequencies called the signal bandwidth.

Suppose we wish to transmit an electronic signal, in the audio frequency range, say 20 Hz to 20kHz range, over a long distance we need to consider factors like

Size of the antenna
Effective power radiated by the antenna
Avoiding mixing of signals from different transmitters
Size of antenna:

Antenna is needed for both transmission and reception
Antenna should have a size comparable to the wavelength of the signal, atleastλ/4 where λ is the wavelength of the signal
In the above audio frequency range, if we consider frequency ט = 15,000 Hz. Then λ = c / ט = 3 * 108 / 15,000 = 20,000 m
Hence, antenna length = λ/4 = 20,000 / 4 = 5000 m.
It is practically impossible to design an antenna of height 5000m
So the transmission frequency should be raised in such a way that the length of the antenna is within 100m which is feasible for practical purpose
This shows that there is a need for converting low frequency signal to high frequency before transmission
 

Effective power radiated by the antenna:

Effective power rated by the antenna = P = E/t
Also, E = hט = hc/λ
Hence, P = E/t = hc/λ * c/λ
Studies reveal that if l is the linear length of the antenna, then P is proporational to (l/λ)2
Hence, for good transmission, high power and hence small wavelength and high frequency waves are required
High frequency waves becomes inevitable in this case also
Avoiding mixing of signals from different transmitters:

When many transmitters are transmitting baseband information signals simultaneously, they all gets mixed up
There is no way to distinguish between them
Possible solution is communication at high frequencies and allotting a band of frequencies for each transmitter so that there is no mixing
This is what is being dene for different radio and TV broadcast stations
Hence, we understand the necessity of modulation.

","Definition, Property, Relation, Formula, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Band width

Bandwidth is also defined as the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time

Signals – Bandwidth:

The message signal can be voice, music, picture or computer data
Each of the above have different frequency ranges
The speech signals frequency range from 300Hz to 3100Hz. Hence, bandwidth = 3100 -300 = 2800 Hz
Any music requires bandwidth of 20kHz because of high frequencies produced by musical instruments
Video signals for transmission of picture requires 4.2 MHz of bandwidth
The Television signal which contains both voice and picture is usually allocated a bandwidth of 6MHz bandwidth for transmission
Transmission Medium – Bandwidth:

Different types of transmission media offers different bandwidth
Coaxial cables, widely used wire medium offers bandwidth of approximately 750 MHz
Communication through free space using radio waves offers wide range from hundreds of kHz to few GHz
Optical fibres are used in the frequency range of 1THz to 1000 THz (THz – Tera Hertz; 1THz = 1012Hz)
As mentioned earlier, to avoid mixing of signals, allotting a band of frequencies to a specific transmitter is in practise
The International Telecommunication Union administers this frequency allocation
Services like FM Broadcast, Television, Cellular Mobile Radio and Satellite communication operate under fixed frequency bands","Definition, Types, Property, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Amplitude modulation

As we know, in amplitude modulation, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in accordance with the amplitude of the information signal or modulating signal.
For sinusoidal modulating wave,
m(t) = Amsinωmt  --------------------------------(1)

Am – Amplitude of modulating signal
ωm- 2πטm – Angular frequency of modulating signal
For carrier wave,
Cm(t) = Acsinωct  --------------------------------(2)

Ac – Amplitude of carrier wave
ωm- 2πטc– Angular frequency of carrier wave
For carrier wave, the amplitude is changed by adding the amplitude of the modulating signal which is Ac plus Amsinωmt
Cm(t) = (Ac+ Amsinωmt) sin ωct  --------------------------------(3)

Multiply and Divide equation (3) RHS by Ac
Cm(t) = Ac (Ac/Ac+Am/Ac sin ωmt) sin ωct  ---------------------------(4)

Replace Am / Ac = µ

µ is called Amplitude modulation index and is always less than or equal to 1 to avoid distortion.

Cm(t) = Acsin ωct + µAc sin ωct sin ωmt   ---------------------------(5)

We know that sin A sin B = ½ [ cos (A-B) – cos (A + B)]
 

Hence, sin ωctsin ωmt = [cos (ωc-ωm)t – cos(ωc+ωm)t]

Cm(t) = Acsin ωct + µAc/2[cos (ωc-ωm)t – cos(ωc+ωm)t]

Cm(t) = Acsin ωct + µAc/2cos (ωc-ωm)t – µAc/2cos(ωc+ωm)t--------(6)

 

Equation (6) shows that the amplitude modulated signal consists of
Carrier wave of frequency ωc
Sinusoidal wave of frequency (ωc-ωm)
Sinusoidal wave of frequency (ωc+ωm)
The two additional waves are called side bands. The frequency of these bands are called side band frequencies
Frequency of lower side band = (ωc-ωm)
Frequency of upper side band = (ωc+ωm)
 

The band width of the AM wave is Frequency of lower side band minus Frequency of upper side band
(ωc+ωm) - (ωc-ωm) = 2ωm (Twice the frequency of modulating signal)

","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Production of amplitude modulated wave

We know that modulating signal is represented by
m(t) = Amsinωmt  --------------------------------(1)

Am – Amplitude of modulating signal
ωm- 2πטm – Angular frequency of modulating signal
Similarly, carrier wave is represented by
Cm(t) = Acsinωct  --------------------------------(2)

Ac – Amplitude of carrier wave
ωm- 2πטc– Angular frequency of carrier wave
 

Modulating signal is added to the carrier wave, Hence, the representation is
x(t) =Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct

The above signal is passed to a square law device (non-linear device)
y(t) =B x(t) + c [x(t)]2

            B,C – Arbitrary constants

Substitute for x(t) in y(t) and use formula (A + B)2 = A2 + B2 + 2AB
y(t) =B[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct] + c[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct]2

 =B[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct] + c[Am2sin2ωmt   + Ac 2sin 2ωct

 + 2 Am Acsin ωmtsin ωct]

We know sin A sin B = ½ [cos (A-B) – cos (A+B)]
               Hence,

                                sinωctsin ωmt = ½ [ cos (ωc – ωm)t – cos (ωc+ ωm)t ]

Also, sin2A = ( 1- cos 2A) /2
Hence,

                sin 2ωct = (1 – cos 2ωct) / 2

                sin 2ωmt = (1 – cos 2ωmt) / 2

 

Therefore y(t) can be re-written as
Y(t) =B[Amsinωmt   + Acsinωct] + cAm2/ 2( 1 – cos2ωmt)

 + cAc2/ 2( 1 – cos2ωct)

+ 2 Am Ac (c/2)[ cos (ωc – ωm)t – cos (ωc+ ωm)t ] ]

Y(t) =BAmsinωmt   + BAcsinωct + c/ 2[Am 2 + Ac2]

 – cAm 2/ 2 cos2ωmt – c Ac2/ 2 cos2ωct

+ cAm Accos (ωc – ωm)t – c Am Accos (ωc+ ωm)t

In the above equation, there is a d.c. term ½ c [Am 2 + Ac2] and sinusoidal waves of frequencyωc, ωm, 2ωm,(ωc – ωm) and (ωc+ ωm)
The signal is passed through band pass filter centered atωc
This rejects the low and high frequencies. In the above case, the filter rejects d.c, ωc,ωm, 2ωm,(ωc – ωm). The frequenciesωc, (ωc – ωm) and (ωc+ ωm) are passed. This is amplitude modulated wave.
This wave cannot be passed as such. It needs to be amplified and then fed to an antenna of appropriate size for radiation.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning",Grade_12_Physics_Data
"Detection of amplitude modulated wave

Detection is the process of recovering the modulating signal from the modulated carrier wave.
The transmitted message gets attenuated in propagating through the channel
 
The receiving antenna receives the signal which is then amplified.


The carrier frequency is changed to a lower frequency by Intermediate frequency (IF) stage


Detection Process:

It is then passed through the detector.
Hence, INPUT – Modulated carrier wave of frequencies ωc, (ωc+ωm) and (ωc-ωm)

"Applications of  Reflection of Sound. Many instruments work on the basis of multiple reflections of sound: Megaphone, loudspeakers, bulb horns, musical instruments like trumpets, shehnais etc.  are designed to send sound by multiple reflections in a particular direction due to which the amplitude of sound waves adds up to increase loudness of sound. Stethoscope which is used by doctors to listen to the sounds from the human body, also works on principle of multiple reflections of sound. Here, sound of heartbeat reaches the doctor's ears by multiple reflections. In big halls or auditoriums sound is absorbed by walls, ceiling, seats, etc. So a curved board (sound board) is placed behind the speaker.

"Sound waves move from the point of generation to the listener through the medium.
When an object vibrates and produces sound, the particles of the medium at the point of generation begin to vibrate.
This particle passes on the vibration to its adjacent/neighboring particle. The first particle comes back to its equilibrium position of rest. Then the second particles passes its vibration to the neighboring third particle and then again comes back to its position of rest. This process continues until the vibration reaches the listener and he is able to hear the sound.","Causes, Reasoning",Grade_9_Physics_Data
"As we see, the actual particles of the medium don't travel from the point of generation to listener. It is only the vibration that travels through the medium. This is called Wave motion.

Echoes may be heard more than once due to successive or multiple reflections.The sensation of any sound persist in our ear for about 0.1 s, which means that to hear a clear echo, the reflected sound must be atleast 0.1 seconds after the original sound.The sensation of any sound persist in our ear for about 1 s. The speed of sound in air at 22 degress is 344m/s. Therefore, Distance = Speed * Time = 344m/s * 0.1 s = 34.4m. That is the full distance ie from the source to the wall and back to the source.

In a big hall, reverberation is required so that the entire hall can hear the sound. At the same time, if the reverberation is very high, the sound will persist for too long even if the source of sound has actually stopped. So, this is undesirable. The reverberation effect should be controlled. Several acoustic techniques are deployed to do this.","Definiton, Property, Reasoning",Grade_9_Physics_Data

"In order to propagate, sound requires a medium through which it can travel. This medium could be a gas, liquid or solid. Sound propagates in a medium as the particles of the medium vibrate from a starting point. This means that sound always has a starting point and an ending point. For instance, while you talk to a friend, as you speak, the particles in the air get displaced due to the pressure caused by the sound you produce. They then displace the adjacent particles and so on. In this way, sound travels from your place to your friend’s ears.Therefore, we can say that the particles of a medium do not travel from one point one another in order to propagate sound.

"When an object vibrates in the air or produces a sound, some regions of high pressure are created in front of it. These are called the Regions of Compression. These regions of compression move forward in the medium as particles exert pressure on their adjacent particles. WIth alternate regions of compression, there are also regions of low pressure that are in its front. Thes are called Regions of Rarefaction. As the object would move forwards and backwards consecutively producing sound, the series of compressions and rarefactions will be created. This will allow sound to move through air or any other medium as well.If the medium is dense the pressure exerted on the particles will be more in order to propagate the sound and vice versa.Therefore, we can also say that propagation of sound is all about change in the pressure of the medium.","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_9_Physics_Data

"According to the Newton’s Second Law of motion force is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum.This means, Force ∝ Rate of change of moentumAfter substituting the value of rate of change of momentum from equation (i) we get.Force (F)  ∝ mv − mu t⇒ F ∝ m(v − u) t ⇒ F ∝ mv − u t ⇒ F ∝ ma [∵ acceleration (a) = v − u t] [Since, acceleration is the rate of change in velocity] ⇒ F = k⋅m⋅a ----(ii) Where k is the proportionality constant ∵ 1 unit force is defined as the mass of 1kg object produces the acceleration of 1m/s2 ∴ 1 unit of force = k × 1 kg × 1m /s 2 ∴ by putting the value of  k =1 in equation (ii) F = m⋅a ----(iii)⇒ Force = mass x acceleration.Thus Newton’s Second Law of Motion gives the relation between force, mass and acceleration of an object.According to the relation obtained above, Newton’s Second Law can be modified as follows:The product of mass and acceleration is the force acting on the object.",Formula,Grade_9_Physics_Data
"The SI unit of Force: Newton (N).

If the ball is stopped suddenly, its momentum will be reduced to zero instantly. The rate of change in momentum is very quick and as a result, the player’s hand may get injured.

So the gravitational pull between the two bodies is: F=Gm1m2r2⇒F=6.67×10−11×60×8012N⇒F=3.2×10−7N………………….(3) Now consider the force between body A and the earth. Mass = 6×1024 Kg.

Principle: -
Inside a hydraulic lift there are 2 platforms,one has a smaller area and the other one has a larger area.
It is a tube like structure which is filled with uniform fluid.
There are 2 pistons (P1 and P2)which are attached at both the ends of the tube.

If we apply force F1 on P1, pressure gets exerted and according to Pascal’s law the pressure gets transmitted in all the directions and same pressure gets exerted on the other end.As a result the Piston P2 moves upwards.
Advantage of using hydraulic lift is that by applying small force on the small area we are able to generate a larger force.

where F2 = Resultant Force,A2 = area of cross-section
F2= (F1/A1)A2 where P=F1/A1 (Pressure P is due to force F1 on the area A1)

Consider a case when all the particles of fluid passing point A have the same velocity. This means that the first particle will have velocity V1 and second will have velocity V1 and so on. All the particles will have the same velocity V1at point A.
At point B,all particleswill have velocity V2.
Similarly at point C the velocity of all the particles is V3.
We can see that the velocity is changing from point to point but at one particular point it is same.
No two streamlines can intersect.
If two streamlines intersect each other, the particleswon’t know which path to follow and what velocity to attain.That is why no two streamlines intersect.

"Equation of Continuity

According to the equation of continuity Av = constant. Where A =cross-sectional area and v=velocity with which the fluid flows.
It means that if any liquid is flowing in streamline flow in a pipe of non-uniform cross-section area, then rate of flow of liquid across any cross-section remains constant.
Consider a fluid flowing through a tube of varying thickness.
Let the cross-sectional area at one end (I) = A1 and cross-sectional area of other end (II)= A2.
The velocity and density of the fluid at one end (I)=v1,ρ1respectively, velocity and densityof fluid at other end (II)= v2,ρ2
Volume covered by the fluid in a small interval of time ∆t,across left cross-sectional is Area (I) =A1xv1x∆t
Volume covered by the fluid in a small interval of time ∆tacrossright cross-sectional Area(II) = A2x v2x∆t
Fluid inside is incompressible(volume of fluid does not change by applying pressure) that is density remains sameρ1=ρ2. (equation 1)
Along(I) mass=ρ1 A1 v1∆t and along second point (II) mass = ρ2A2 v2∆t
By using equation (1). We can conclude that A1 v1 = A2 v2.This is the equation of continuity.
From Equation of continuity we can say that Av=constant.
This equation is also termed as “Conservation of mass of incompressible fluids”.","Definition, Formula",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Volume flux/Flow rate remains constant throughout the pipe. This means rate of flow of fluid of liquidis more if cross-sectional area is more, then the velocity will be less,andvice-versa.
But the Av will remain constant.
So the volume which is covered by the fluid at any cross-sectional area is constant throughout the pipe even if pipe has different cross-sectional areas.
The fluid is accelerated while passing from the wider cross sectional area towards the narrower area. This means if area is more the velocity is less and vice-versa.","Definition, Formula, Reasonign",Grade_11_Physics_Data

"Derive: Bernoulli’s equation

Assumptions:

Fluid flow through a pipe of varying width.
Pipe is located at changing heights.
Fluid is incompressible.
Flow is laminar.
No energy is lost due to friction:applicable only to non-viscous fluids.
Mathematically: -
Consider the fluid initially lying between B and D. In an infinitesimal timeinterval Δt, this fluid would have moved.
Suppose v1= speed at B and v2= speedat D, initial distance moved by fluid from to C=v1Δt.
In the same interval Δtfluid distance moved by D to E = v2Δt.
P1= Pressureat A1, P2=Pressure at A2.
Work done on the fluid atleft end (BC) W1 = P1A1(v1Δt).
Work done by the fluid at the other end (DE)W2 = P2A2(v2Δt)
Net work done on the fluid is W1 – W2 = (P1A1v1Δt− P2A2v2Δt)
By the Equation of continuity Av=constant.
P1A1 v1Δt - P2A2v2Δt where A1v1Δt =P1ΔV and A2v2Δt = P2ΔV.
Therefore Work done = (P1− P2) ΔVequation (a)
Part of this work goes in changing Kinetic energy, ΔK = (½)m (v22 – v12) and part in gravitational potential energy,ΔU =mg (h2 − h1).
The total change in energy ΔE= ΔK +ΔU = (½) m (v22 – v12) + mg (h2 − h1). (i)
Density of the fluid ρ =m/V or m=ρV
Therefore in small interval of time Δt, small change in mass Δm
Δm=ρΔV (ii)
Putting the value from equation (ii) to (i)
ΔE = 1/2 ρΔV (v22 – v12) + ρgΔV (h2 − h1)  equation(b)
By using work-energy theorem: W = ΔE
From (a) and (b)
(P1-P2) ΔV =(1/2) ρΔV (v22 – v12) + ρgΔV (h2 − h1)
P1-P2 = 1/2ρv22 - 1/2ρv12+ρgh2 -ρgh1(By cancelling ΔV from both the sides).
After rearranging we get,P1 + (1/2) ρ v12 + ρg h1 = (1/2) ρ v22 + ρg h2
P+(1/2) ρv2+ρg h = constant.
This is the Bernoulli’s equation.

When a fluid is at rest. This means v1=v2=0.

By puttingv1=v2=0 in the above equation changes to
P1-P2= ρg(h2-h1). This equation is same as when the fluids are at rest.
When the pipe is horizontal.h1=h2.This means there is no Potential energy by the virtue of height.

"Dynamic Lift

Dynamic lift is the normal force that acts on a body by virtue of its motion through a fluid.
Consider an object which is moving through the fluid,and due to the motion of the object through the fluid there is a normal force which acts on the body.
This force is known as dynamic lift.
Dynamic lift is most popularly observed in aeroplanes.
Whenever an aeroplane is flying in the air, due to its motion through the fluid here fluid is air in the atmosphere.Due to its motion through this fluid, there is a normal force which acts on the body in the vertically upward direction.
This force is known as Dynamic lift.

Because of pressure difference there is an upward force which is the dynamic lift.",Reasoning ,Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Viscosity is the property of a fluid that resists the force tending to cause the fluid to flow.
It is analogous to friction in solids.
Example:-
Consider 2 glasses one filled with water and the other filled with honey.
Water will flow down the glass very rapidly whereas honey won’t.This is because honey is more viscous than water.
Therefore in order to make honey flow we need to apply greater amount of force. Because honey has the property to resist the motion.

Consider a single rain drop, when rain drop is falling it is passing through air.
The air has some viscosity; there will be some force which will try to stop the motion of the rain drop.
Initially the rain drop accelerates but after some time it falls with constant velocity.
As the velocity increases the retarding force also increases.
There will be viscous force Fv and bind force Fbacting in the upward direction.There will also be Fggravitational force acting downwards.

Certain properties of free surfaces:-
Whenever liquids are poured in any container they take the shape of that container in which they are poured and they acquire a free surface.

Top surface of the glass is a free surface. Water is not in contact with anything else,it is in contact with the air only.

"Surface Energy
Surface energy is the excess energy exhibited by the liquid molecules on the surface compared to those inside the liquid.

"When molecules are inside the liquid:- 
Suppose there is a molecule inside the water,there will be several other molecules that will attract that molecule in all the directions.

This results in negative potential energy of the molecule as it binds the molecule.
To separate this molecule huge amount of energy is required to overcome potential energy.
Some external energy is required to move this molecule and it should be greater than the potential energy.

"When the molecules are at the surface:- 
When the molecule is at the surface, half of it will be inside and half of it is exposed to the atmosphere.
For the lower half of the molecule it will be attracted by the other molecules inside the liquid.
But the upper half is free. The negative potential energy is only because of lower half.
But the magnitude is half as compared to the potential energy of the molecule which is fully inside the liquid.
So the molecule has some excess energy, because of this additional energy which the molecules have at the surface different phenomenon happen like surface energy, surface tension.

"Surface Tension
Surface tension is the property of the liquid surface which arises due to the fact that surface molecules have extra energy.
Surface energy is the extra energy which the molecules at the surface have.
Surface tension is the property of the liquid surface because the molecules have extra energy.
Surface energy is defined as surface energy per unit area of the liquid surface.

Mathematically :- 
Consider a case in which liquid is enclosed in a movable bar.
Slide the bar slightly and it moves some distance (‘d’).
There will be increase in the area, (dl) where l=length of the bar.
Liquids have two surfaces one on the bar and other above the bar. Therefore area=2(dl)

Surface tension is the surface energy per unit area of the liquid surface.
It can be also defined as Force per unit length on the liquid surface.
Important: -At any interface (it is a line which separates two different medium) the surface tension always acts in equal and opposite direction and it is always perpendicular to the line at the interface.Schematic picture of molecules in a liquid, at the surface and balance of forces

In the surroundings there is water and in middle there is cavity filled with air.

Pressure inside a drop and a cavity
Pressure inside a drop is greater than the pressure outside.
Suppose there is a spherical drop of water of radius ‘r’ which is in equilibrium.
Consider there is increase in radius which is Δr.
Therefore Extra Surface energy = Surface Tension(S) x area 
= Sla x 4π(r+Δr)2 – Slax4πr2
After calculating
Extra Surface energy=8πr Δr Sla
At Equilibrium, Extra Surface energy = Energy gain due to the pressure difference
8πr Δr Sla = (Pi - Po) 4πr2xΔr
where Pi= Pressure inside the drop and Po = Pressure outside the drop.
                        After calculation Pi - Po = 2 Sla/rPressure inside a Bubble
Pressure inside a bubble is greater than the pressure outside.
As bubble has 2 interfaces, Pi-Po=2Sla/r x 2

"Capillary Rise
In Latin the word capilla means hair.
Due to the pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface the water rises up in a narrow tube in spite of gravity.
Consider a vertical capillary tube of circular cross section (radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water.
The contact angle between water and glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in the capillary is concave. As a result there is a pressure difference between the two sides of the top surface. This is given by 
(Pi – Po) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )= (2S/a) cos θ (i)
Thus the pressure of the water inside thetube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)is less than the atmospheric pressure.
Considerthe two points A and B. Theymust be at the same pressure, 
P0 + h ρ g = Pi = PA (ii)
where ρ is the density of water,and h is called the capillary
h ρ g = (Pi – P0) = (2S cos θ )/a (By using equations (i) and (ii))

COLLISION. Collision between the two bodies is defined as mutual interaction of the bodies for a short interval of time due to which the energy and the momentum of the interacting bodies change.,Definition,Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Types of Collision. There are basically three types of collisions-  i) Elastic Collision � That is the collision between perfectly elastic bodies. In this type of collision, since only conservative forces are operating between the interacting bodies, both kinetic energy and momentum of the system remains constant. ii) Inelastic Collision � That is the collision between perfectly inelastic or plastic bodies. After collision bodies stick together and move with some common velocity. In this type of collision only momentum is conserved. Kinetic energy is not conserved due to the presence of non-conservative forces between the interacting bodies. iii) Partially Elastic or Partially Inelastic Collision � That is the collision between the partially elastic bodies. In this type of collision bodies do separate from each other after collision but due to the involvement of non-conservative inelastic forces kinetic energy of the system is not conserved and only momentum is conserved. Consider two bodies of masses m1 and m2 with their center of masses moving along the same straight line in same direction with initial velocities u and u2 with m1 after m2. Condition necessary for the collision is u1 > u2 due to which bodies start approaching towards each other with the velocity of approach u2-u1 . Collision starts as soon as the bodies come in contact. Due to its greater velocity and inertia m1continues to push m 2in the forward direction whereas m due to its small velocity and inertia pushes m1 in the backward direction. Due to this pushing force involved between the two colliding bodies they get deformed at the point of contact and a part of their kinetic energy gets consumed in the deformation of the bodies. Also m1 being pushed opposite to the direction of the motion goes on decreasing its velocity and m being pushed in the direction of motion continues increasing its velocity. This process continues until both the bodies acquire the same common velocity v. Up to this stage there is maximum deformation in the bodies maximum part of their kinetic energy gets consumed in their deformation.","Types, Definition",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Elastic collision. In case of elastic collision bodies are perfectly elastic. Hence after their maximum deformation they have tendency to regain their original shapes, due to which they start pushing each other. Since m2 is being pushed in the direction of motion its velocity goes on increasing and m1 being pushed opposite to the direction of motion its velocity goes on decreasing. Thus condition necessary for separation i.e. v is attained and the bodies get separated with velocity of separation v2 - v1 . In such collision the part of kinetic energy of the bodies which has been consumed in the deformation of the bodies is again returned back to the system when the bodies regain their original shapes.

Energy can be put in storage, but that cannot be done for work.  Work is energy in motion. Energy alters from one form to another by the process of doing work. Usually, there are two sorts of work Positive and negative work.

You might have noticed that you feel hotter on a sunny afternoon as compared to a windy night. This is because of the difference in temperatures. Temperature is very high in the afternoon as compared to night. This chapter basically gives us the

"Measurement of Temperature

Temperature is measured with the help of thermometer. Mercury and Alcohol are commonly used liquids in the liquid-in-glass thermometers.

To construct a thermometer two fixed points are to be chosen as a reference points. These fixed points are known as freezing(ice point) and boiling point(steam point). The water freezes and boils at these two points under standard pressure.
The ice and steam point in Fahrenheit Temperature scale are 32°F and 212 °F resp.It has 180 equal intervals between two reference points.
On Celsius Scale values are 0°C and 100°C for ice and steam point resp. It has 100 equal intervals between two reference points.
(tf -32)/180 = tc/100

"Ideal-gas Equation and Absolute Temperature

A thermometer that uses any gas, however, gives the same readings regardless of which gas is used because all gases have same expansion at low temperature.

Variables that describe the behaviour of gas are:-

Quantity(mass)
Pressure
Volume
Temperature i.e. (P,V,T) where (T = t + 273.15; t is the temperature in °C)
Gases which have low density obey certain laws: -

1.Boyle’s Law– PV = constant(when temperature T is constant)

2.Charles’ Law- V/T = constant (when pressure P is constant)

 

If combine both the above laws the equation becomes PV = RT where R is called universal gas constant and its value = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1.
PV = RT is the ideal gas equation which is applicable only at low temperature.
For any quantity of dilute gas,
PV=μRT where μ, is the number of moles in the sample of gas.

In a constant volume gas thermometer temperature varies with respect to pressure. Temperature changes linearly with increase in pressure.","Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data

"Thermal Expansion

Thermal expansion is the phenomenon of increase in dimensions of a body due to increase in its temperature.",Definition,Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Examples of Thermal Expansion

The water is cold at the top of the lake because it expands and becomes less dense. So when this water freezes it insulates the water below it from the outside which means cold air is like a blanket. It is because of this property many fish can survive in the winter.
As soon as we turn on a hot water tap, the water comes very fast as water is still cold .But as soon as hot water starts coming , the flow of water becomes less and in some cases it stops. This is because the hot water heats the metal valve inside the tap which expands to block off any more flow of water.","Examples, Property",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Reason why Thermal Expansion happens is:-

When any object is heated particles start moving in random motion and thus average distance between the molecules increases and a result the object appears to be expanded when heated. As we can see the picture below atoms is tightly packed but when we apply heat they will start moving in random motion.","Causes, Property",Grade_11_Physics_Data

l to l+Δl.                                              

Coefficient of Linear Expansion is a parameter which tells us how the size of the object changes with change in temperature. It is defined as degree of linear expansion divided by the change in temperature.

If the solid is in the form of long rod, then for small change in temperature, ΔT, the fractional change in length, Δl/l, is directly proportional to ΔT.

As we can see from above images the area of the cube has been increased from A to A + ΔA.

Mathematically can be written as:-

ΔA / A =αa ΔT

Where αa = coefficient of area expansion.

"Anomalous Behaviour of Water

Water shows some exceptional behaviour that is when it is heated at 0°C, it contracts instead of expanding and it happens till it reaches 4 °C. The volume of a given amount of water is minimumat 4 °C therefore its density is maximum(Refer the Fig). After 4 °C water starts expanding. Below 4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore the density decreases. This means water has maximum density at 4 °C.
Advantages of Anomalous behaviour of Water
Because of this property of water in lakes and ponds freeze only at the top layer and at the bottom it does not, butif the water freezes at the bottom also then animal and plant life would not be possible.",Property,Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Relation between αv and αl

Relation between coefficient of linear expansion and coefficient of volume expansion =


To derive the above relation consider a block of cube initially its length is l ,suppose temperature is increased T + ΔT as a result length will also increase from (l+Δl)

Then αl= (Δl/l)/ ΔT

Therefore,αllΔT = Δl

Also as the temperature increases by ΔT the volume also increases V +ΔV

Where ΔV = change in volume which we can write as

ΔV = (l+Δl)3 – l3

By solving we get ΔV= 3l2Δl(we are neglecting (Δl)2 and (Δl)3as they are very small as to compared to l.

Therefore, Δ V = (3V Δl)/l

                        =3VαlΔT

Which gives αv = 3αl the relation between coefficient of volume expansion and coefficient of linear expansion.

Thermal stress:

Mechanical stress induced by a body when some or all of its parts are not free to expand or contract in response to change in temperature.
When an object is heated or cooled either it expands or it contracts but if for some reason if the object is not allowed to expand to contract under that case mechanical stress is induced in the body which is known as Thermal Stress.

If we have a block of ice and a copper wire pulled by two masses if we will observe that copper wire can pass through ice block this is because copper is good conductor of heat so as it passes through the ice it gets refreeze as the copper will generate heat and this heat will pass quickly to the ice below and it starts melting because there is increase in pressure which lowers temperature as a result the wire will move through the ice.

Boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure is known as normal boiling point.
It depends on nature of substance & pressure
It increases with increase in pressure and vice versa.
Example: As altitude increases, the density of the air becomes thinner, and thus exerts less pressure. At high altitudes, external pressure on water is therefore decreased and will hence take less energy to break the water.

The specific heat capacity of a gas at constant pressure is greater than the specific heat capacity of the gas at constant volume i.e. Cp > Cυ. Reason is that when heat supplied to a gas at constant volume, no work would be done by the gas against the external pressure and all the energy is used to raise the temperature of the gas. On the other hand when the heat is supplied to the gas at constant pressure, its volume increases and the heat energy supplied to it is used to increase the temperature of the gas as well as in doing the work against the external pressure.

What is Kinetic Theory?

Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules.
In solids the molecules are very tightly packed as inter molecular space is not present In liquids inter molecular spaces are more as compared to solids and in gases the molecules are very loosely packed as intermolecular spaces are very large.
The random movement of molecules in a gas is explained by kinetic theory of gases.
We will also see that why kinetic theory is accepted as a success theory.

John Dalton

Atomic hypothesis was given by many scientists. According to which everything in this universe is made up of atoms.
Atoms are little particles that move around in a perpetual order attracting each other when they are little distance apart.
But if they are forced very close to each other then they rebel.
For example: - Consider a block of gold. It consists of molecules which are constantly moving.
Dalton’s atomic theory is also referred as the molecular theory of matter.This theory proves that matter is made up of molecules which in turn are made up of atoms.
According to Gay Lussac’s law when gases combine chemically to yield another gas,their volumes are in ratios of small integers.
Avogadro’s law states that the equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules.
Conclusion: - All these laws proved the molecular nature of gases.

"Behaviour of Gases

Gases at low pressures and high temperatures much above that at which they liquify (or solidify) approximately satisfy a relation between their pressure, temperature and volume:
PV=KT (i)
This is the universal relation which is satisfied by all gases.
where P, V, T are pressure,volume and temperature resp. and
K is the constant for a given volume of gas. It varies with volume of gas.
K=NkB where
N=number of molecules and
kB = Boltzmann Constant and its value never change.
From equation (i) PV= NkB
Therefore PV/NT = constant=(kB)(Same for all gases).
Consider there are 2 gases :- (P1,V1,T1) and (P2, V2,T2) where P, V and T are pressure, volume and temperature resp.
Therefore P1,V1/(N1T1) = P2V2/(N2T2)
Conclusion: - This relation is satisfied by all gases at low pressure and high temperature.","Property, Relation, Formula",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Justification of the Avogadro’s hypothesis from equation of gas

Avogadro’s hypothesis states that equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules.
Consider the equation PV/NT = constant and if P,V and T are same for 2 gases then N(number of molecules) is also same.
According to Avogadro’s hypothesis number of molecules per unit volume is same for all gasesat a fixed P and T.
Avogadro number is denoted by NA. WhereA denotes Avogadro number.
NA = 6.02x1023. It is universal value.

PV = (N/NA)RT(putting μ=N/NA in equation(i))
By simplifying PV = NkBT
PV=NkBT => P = (N/V) kBT => P=nkBT where n(number density) =N/V where N=number of molecules and V=volume.
Therefore we get PV=nkBT
Substitute μ = M/Mo in equation(i)
PV=(M/Mo) RT => P=(M/V)1/MoRT where

Graph should be a straight line(parallel to x-axis) for ideal gas.
This means it has constant value at all temperature and all pressure.
But in case of real gases graph approach ideal gas behaviour at high temperature and low pressure.
At high temperature and low pressure molecules are far apart. When temperature is increased the molecules will move randomly far from each other.
As a result molecular interaction decreases the gas behaves as an ideal gas.

"Deducing Dalton’s Law of partial pressures

Dalton’s law of partial pressure states that the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of partial pressures.
Consider if there are several ideal gases mixed together in a vessel,then the total pressure of that vessel is equal to sum of partial pressure.
Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by a particular gas if only that gas is present in the vessel.
For example: -
Consider if in a vessel there is a mixture of 3 gases, A,B and C.So the partial pressure of A is equal to pressure exerted only by Aand considering B and C are not present.
Similarly partial pressure of B is equal to the pressure exerted only by B and considering A and C are not there.
Similarly for C.
According to Dalton’s law the total pressure of mixture is sum of partial pressure of A, partial pressure of B and partial pressure of C","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"To show how perfect gas equation concludes Dalton’s law of partial pressure:-

Suppose there is a mixture of ideal gases which means these gases do not interact with each other.
By perfect gas equation PV=μRT
Where V=volume of vessel,P=Pressure and T=temperature andμ (no. of moles).
As there are mixture of gases therefore μ=μ1+μ2+ ---- so on.
PV=( μ1+μ2)RT
P=( μ1+μ2)RT/V =>μ1RT/V + μ2RT/V + ---
P=P1+P2 +----
Where P1=partial pressure of gas 1 and P2=partial pressure of gas 2.
Therefore P= P1+P2+---total pressure due to the mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressure of the gas.","Reasoning, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data

Molecules of gas are in incessant random motion,colliding against one another

"What does Kinetic Theory tells?

At ordinary temperature and pressure the molecular size is very small as compared to inter molecular distance between them.
In case of gas, molecules are very far from each other and the size of molecules is small as compared to the distance between them.
As a result, interaction between them is negligible. As there is no interaction between the molecules, there will be no force between the molecules.
As a result molecules are moving freely as per newton’s first law of motion.
The molecules should move along straight line but when they come closer they experience the intermolecular forces and as a result their velocities change.
This phenomenon is known as collision.These collisions are elastic.
","Property, Reasoning, Property, Effects",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Justifying the assumptions:-

We have assumed the container containing the gas is a cube. The shape of the container is immaterial.
For a vessel of any arbitrary shape, we can choose a small infinitesimal (planar) area and can prove the above derivation.
We will see A and Δt are not there in the final result.
By Pascal’s law pressure in one portion of gas in equilibrium is the same as anywhere else.
All collisions are neglected.
The number of molecules hitting the wall in time Δt was found to be ½ n AvxΔt, with random collisionsand asteady state of gas.
Thus, if a molecule with velocity (vx, vy,vz)acquires a different velocity due to collision withsome molecules, there will always be some othermolecule with a different initial velocity whichafter a collision acquires the velocity (vx, vy, vz).
Molecular collision, when they are not too frequent and the time spent in collision is very small compared to the time between collisions, will not have any affect in the above calculation.","Effects, Reasoning",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Law of Equipartition of energy:Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of Freedom can be defined as independent displacements or rotations that specify the orientation of a body or system.
A molecule free to move in space needs three coordinates to specify its location.
If it is constrained to move in a plane it needs to.
If constrained to move along a line, it needs just one coordinate to locate it.

Take a ball which is moving straight on the rope.

"Translational degree of freedom:-

Translation means motion of the body as a whole from one point to another.
For example:
Consider the oxygen molecule;it has 2 oxygen atoms which are bonded together.
The 2 oxygen atoms along with the bond are considered as whole body.
When the body as a whole is moving from one point to another is known as translational.
Consider a molecule which is free to move in space and so it will need 3 coordinates(x, y, z) to specify its location.
Therefore it has 3 degrees of freedom.
Similarly a molecule which is free to move in a plane which is 2 dimensional and so it needs 2 coordinates to specify its location.
Therefore it has 2 degrees of freedom.
Similarly a molecule which is free to move in line it needs 1 coordinate to specify its location.
Therefore it has 1 degree of freedom.
Molecules of monoatomic gas have only translational degrees of freedom.This means gases which have only one atom.
For example:-Helium atom it consists of only one He atom.It will have translationaldegrees of freedom.

"Introduction

In this chapter we will learn about oscillatory motion or oscillations. Any motion which repeats itself at regular intervals of time is known as periodic motion. If a body moves back and forth repeatedly about its mean position then it is said to be in oscillatory motion.

In the above image we can see that there is a block whose one end is attached to a spring and another is attached to a rigid wall.x is the displacement from the wall.

In the above figure a blockis attached to a spring, the other end of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The block moves on a frictionless surface. The motion of the block can be described in terms of its distance or displacement x from the wall.

f (t) = A cos ωt

As cosine function repeats after 2π so it can be written as

cos (θ) = cos (ωt + 2π)            Equation (1)

cos (ωt) = cos (ωt + 2π) (it keep on repeating after 2π)

 

Let Time Period = T

f (T) = f(t+T) where displacement keeps on repeating after (t+T)

Acos (ωt) = cosω(t+T) = Acos (ωt+ wT)

Acosωt = A cos (ωt+ωT)          Equation (2)

"SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a periodic motion the body moves to and fro about its mean position.The restoring force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement and is always directed towards its mean position.

In the above image we can see that a particle is vibrating to and fro within the limits –A and +A.

The oscillatory motion is said to be SHM if the displacement x of the particle from origin varies with time t:

x (t) = A cos (ωt + Φ)

Where

x (t) : displacement x as a function of time

A= amplitude

It is defined as magnitude of maximum displacement of the particle from its mean position.
ωt +Φ = phase angle (time-dependent)

ω= angular frequency

Φ = phase constant

SHM is a periodic motion in which displacement is a sinusoidal function of time.

"Angular Frequency (ω)

Angular frequency refers to the angular displacement per unit time. It can also be defined as the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g., in oscillations and waves). Angular frequency is larger than frequency ν (in cycles per second, also called Hz), by a factor of 2π.

Consider the oscillatory motion which is varying with time t and displacement x of the particle from the origin:

x (t) = cos (ωt + Φ)

Let Φ = 0

x (t) = cos (ωt)

After t=T i.e. x (t) = x (t+T)

A cos ωt = A cos ω (t + T)

Now the cosine function is periodic with period 2π, i.e., it first repeats itself after 2π. Therefore,

ω (t + T) = ωt + 2π

i.e. ω = 2π/ T

Where ω = angular frequency of SHM.

I. unit is radians per second.
It is 2π times the frequency of oscillation.
Two simple harmonic motions may have the same A and φ, but different ω.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"SHM & Uniform Circular Motion

Uniform Circular motion can be interpreted as a SHM.

To explain above statement:- Consider a ball tied to a thread and moving in a circular path such a way it appears to be in circular motion for a person who is observing it from top view or who is standing in the same plane as we are. But it appears to be SHM if somebody is standing in the same plane of motion.
Case 1: It is executing circular motion.



Case 2: Circular motion observed by a person when standing on the same plane.

 

Case 3: It is appears to be SHM for a person who is standing in the same line of sight.

Mathematically:-

Consider any particle moving in a circular path whose radius is R

Angular velocity = w

Angular position =∫θ dt

                       =wt + φ

Consider the projection of particle on x-axis be P’.

Displacement = Acosθ

                       x=A cos(wt+ φ)

the above equation same as the equation of simple harmonic motion

 

As the particle is moving in the same way the projections are also moving.

When the particle is moving in the upper part of circle then the projections start moving towards left.
When the particle is moving in the lower part of the circle then the projections are moving towards right.
We can conclude that the particle is swinging from left to right and again from right to left.
This to and fro motion is SHM.

Conclusion: -

SHM is the projection of uniform circular motion on the diameter of the circle in which the SHM takes place.

"Velocity in Simple Harmonic Motion

Uniform Circular motion can be defined as motion of an object in a circle at a constant speed.
Consider a particle moving in circular path
The velocity at any point P at any time t will be tangential to the point P.
Consider θ = ωt+ φ where
θ = angular position
ω = angular velocity of the particle
To calculate the value of velocity along the x-axis for theprojectionP’which is executing SHM.
To find the component of velocity along -ive x-axis, we can write = -v cos(900 - θ)
This is can be written as:

= -v cos [900 – (ωt + φ)]
v (t) = - v sin(ωt+ φ) (Equation 1)
where

v (t) is instantaneous velocity of the particle executing the SHM.
(-ive sign tells that the velocity is directed towards negative x-axis)
To verify whether the Equation(1)is same if we calculate directly from SHM:-
x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)

where

x(t) = displacement vector
v (t) = dx/dt

where

v(t) = velocity
dx/dt is rate of change of displacement
= -Awsin (wt + φ)

v (t) =  - A w sin(wt + φ)  (Same as Equation(1))

We can see from the above equation that the radius of the circular motionbecomes the amplitude of the SHM.
Instantaneous velocity of the particle executing SHM is given as:-  v (t) = - A w sin(wt + φ)","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Acceleration in Simple Harmonic Motion

Acceleration in uniform circular motion always directed towards the centre. It is known as radial acceleration.
ap = -ω2r where r = radius
Consider a particle moving in a circular path. Particle is at some point P at some instant of time, radius of circular path is equal to amplitude.
Acceleration will be given as
ap = -ω2Awhere

A = radius of the circle
(-ive sign shows it is pointing towards the centre of the circle.)
Consider the acceleration of the projection of the particle P’ on the x-axis.
Accelerationwill be given as
a(t) = -ap cosθ
a(t) = - ap cos(ωt + φ)
=ω2A cos (ωt + φ)
a(t) = - ω2x(t) (Using x(t)= A cos (ωt + φ))
 To verify expression for acceleration when calculated directly from SHM -

Displacement in SHM is = A cos (ωt + φ)
Velocity v(t) in SHM is = -Aw sin (ωt + φ)
Therefore,

a(t) = dv/dt
= - ω2A cos (ωt + φ)
a(t) = - ω2x(t) (Using x(t)= A cos (ωt + φ))
Equation of acceleration of the particle which executesSHM:-

a(t) = - ω2x(t)  

We can conclude that:-

a is proportional to displacement
acceleration is always directed towards the centre(in circular motion centre is mean position of the SHM)
From above we can say that

SHM is the projection of the uniform circular motion such that centre of uniform circular motion becomes the mean position of the SHM and the radius of the circular motion is the amplitude of the SHM.
In the above figure we can see that the acceleration, a(t), of the particle P′ is the projection of the acceleration a of the reference particle P.

In all the below graphs displacement, velocity and acceleration all have the same time period T, but they differ in phase.

The acceleration is maximum where velocity is minimum and vice-versa.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data

The kinetic energy (K) of a particle executing SHM can be defined as

K=½ k A2 sin2 (ωt + φ)

The above expression is a periodic function of time, being zero when the displacement is maximum and maximum when the particle is at the mean position.
The potential energy (U) of a particleexecuting simple harmonic motion is,

U= ½ k A2 cos2 (ωt + φ)

The potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is alsoperiodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean position and maximum at the extremedisplacements.
Total energy of the system always remains the same

E = U + K

= ½ k A2 sin2 (ωt + φ) + ½ k A2 cos2 (ωt + φ)

"In this chapter we will see the importance of waves in our life.

We will also study about the different properties of waves, some terms related to waves and also about different types of waves.We will also learn how waves propagate.

For example: -

Medium required by the waves to travel from one point to another:-
Consider a boy holding a thread and one end of thread is tied to the wall.
When a boy moves the thread, the thread moves in the form of a wave.
Similarly a boat sailing over the sea,the boat is able to move because of waves.
The ripples formed in a lake when we drop a stone in the lake.They are also waves.
Earthquakes are caused due to the waves under the surface of the earth.
The strings of the guitar when we play them are also waves again.

Satelliteshelp ustouseTV, mobile phones, music system, the sun, the traffic lights, microwave,x-rays.

Some type of waves can propagate from one point to another without any medium.

Waves which are related to matter:-

For example: - whole of universe.","Property, Examples",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"What is a wave?

A wave is s disturbance that propagates through space and time,usually with transference of energy.

For example: -

Consider the sound of the horn; this sound reaches our ear because of sound waves.
There is transfer of energy from one point to another with the help of particles in the medium.
These particles don’t move they just move around their mean position,but the energy is getting transferred from one particle to another and it keeps on transferring till it reaches the destination.
The movement of a particle is initiated by the disturbance.And this disturbance is transferred from one point to another through space and time.
Note:-Energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to another.

When a source of energy causes vibration to travel through the medium a wave is created.

It is an abstract concept.
Examples: - pencil, sun, moon, earth, ball, atoms.","Definition, Property, Examples, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Transverse Waves

The transverse waves are those in which direction of disturbance or displacement in the medium is perpendicular to that of the propagation of wave.
The direction in which a wave propagates is perpendicular to the direction of disturbance.


For example:-

Consider a manholding one end of a thread and other end of the threadis fixed to wall.
When a little jerk is given to the thread in the upward direction.The entire thread moves in a wavy manner.
The jerk propagated along the entire length of the thread.
The small disturbance which came from the source at one end, that disturbance getting propagatedand that is known as direction of propagation.
Disturbance is vertically upward and wave is horizontal.They are perpendicular to each other.
This type of wave is known as transverse wave.
 

A single pulse is sent along a stretched string. A typical element of the string (suchas that marked with a dot) moves up and then down as the pulse passes through.

The element’s motion is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels.","Definition, Property, Examples",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"How are transverse waves caused?

When we pull a thread in upward direction the formation and propagation of the waves are possible because entire thread is under tension.
This tension is the small disturbance which is given at one end and it gets transferred to its neighbouring molecules.
This will keep on continuing.So this small pulse will get propagated along the length of the thread.
The movement of the particles is perpendicular to the propagation of the wave and the wave will propagate horizontally.
 

It is a transverse wave.

A sinusoidal wave is sent along the string.A typical element of the string moves up and down continuously as the wave passes.
Conclusion: -

Transverse waves are those waves which propagates perpendicular to the direction of the disturbance.
Direction of disturbance is the direction of motion of particles of the medium.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Causes",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Longitudinal Waves

Longitudinal means something related to length.
In longitudinal waves direction of disturbance or displacement in the medium is along the propagation of the wave.


For example: - Sound waves. Particles and wave moving along the horizontal direction. So both are in the same direction.
In a Longitudinal wave there are regions where particles are very close to each other.These regions are known as compressions.
In some regions the particles are far apart.Those regions are known as rarefactions.","Definition, Property, Examples",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Displacement in a progressive wave

Amplitude and phase together describe the complete displacement of the wave.
Displacement function is a periodic in space and time.
Displacement of the particles in a medium takes place along the y-axis.
Generally displacement is denoted as a function of X and T, but here it is denoted by y.
In case of transverse wave displacement is given as:
y(x,t) where x=propagation of the wave along x-axis, and particles oscillates along y-axis.
Therefore y(x,t)= A sin(kx – ωt + φ).This is the expression for displacement.
This expression is same as displacement equation which is used in oscillatory motion.
As cosine function;y(x,t)= B cos(kx – ωt + φ),As both sine and cosine function)y (x, t) = A sin (kx – ωt + φ) + B cos(kx – ωt + φ)
Mathematically:

Wave travelling along +X-axis: y(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ).
Consider y=asin(kx – ωt + φ)=> y/a=sin(kx – ωt + φ)
sin-1(y/a) = kx-ωt =>kx=sin-1(y/a) +ωt
x=(1/k)sin-1(y/a)+ (ωt/k)
Wave travelling along –X-axis: x=(1/k)sin-1(y/a)-(ωt/k)(only change in the sign ofωt)
Conclusion:-
As time t increases the value of x increases. This implies the x moves along x-axis.
As time t decreases the value of x decrease. This implies the x moves along (-)ive x-axis.","Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Amplitude and Phase of a wave

Amplitude and phase together describes the position of the particle.
Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the elements of the medium from their equilibrium positions as wave passes through them.
It is denoted by A.
In case of transverse wave ,

The distance between the point P and Q (in the Figure) is maximum displacement. This maximum displacement of the particles is known as amplitude.

In case of longitudinal wave,

There are regions of compressions (particles are closely packed) and rarefactions (particles are far apart).
In compressions density of the wave medium is highest and in rarefactions density of the wave is lowest.
Consider when the particle is at rarefaction, in that region as particle gets more space as a result the particles oscillates to the maximum displacement.
Whereas in compressed region the particles oscillates very less as the space is not very much.
The peak or the maximum amplitude is the centre of two compressed regions.Because at the centre of the two compressed region the particle is most free to displace to maximum displaced position.
Conclusion:-

In case of longitudinal wave the particles will not oscillate to a very large distance. This displacement won’t represent the amplitude as it is not maximum possible displacement.
Amplitude is represented basically by the centre of the rarefaction region where the particle is most free to oscillate to its maximum displacement.","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_11_Physics_Data

In figure (2) as it is not starting from 0, therefore φ=π/2.

"Wavelength 

The term wavelength means length of the wave.
Wavelength is defined as the minimum distance between two consecutive points in the same phase of wave motion.
It is denoted by λ.
In case of transverse wave we use the term crest for the peak of the maximum displacement.
The point of minimum displacement is known as trough.
In case of transverse wave wavelength is the distance between two consecutive crests or distance between two consecutive troughs.
In case of longitudinal wave wavelength is the distance between the two compressions or the distance between the two rarefactions provided the compressions or rarefactions are nearest.","Definition, Property",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Wave Number

Wave number describes the number of wavelengths per unit distance.

Denoted by ‘k’.

y(x,t)= a sin(kx – ωt + φ) assuming φ=0.

At initial time t=0:-
y(x,0)=asin kx (i)
When x=x+λ then y(x+λ,0)=a sink(x+λ)   (ii)
When x=x+2λ then y(x+2λ,0)=a sink(x+2λ)
Value of y is equal at all points because all the points’ λ, 2λ are in phase with each other. Therefore,

From(i) and (ii) asin kx= a sink(x+λ)  =asin(kx+k λ)

This is true if and only if: -k λ =2 πn, where n=1, 2, 3…

k=(2 π n)/ λ. This is the expression for wave number.

"The speed of a travelling wave

To determine the speed of a travelling wave.
The propagation of the wave always takes place along the +(ive) x-axis.
It is denoted by v.
Consider transverse wave moving along (+) ive x axis.
Displacement equation y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt) assuming φ=0.
In case of transverse wave the y denotes the movement of particles along y-axis.x denotes the direction of wave propagation in terms of x axis.
y-axis denotes the displacement of the particles of the medium in case of transverse wave and in case of longitudinal wavex denotes the movement of the particles along x-axis.
In case of longitudinal wave the motion of particles takes place along x-axis and not along y-axis.
The form of equation remains the same for both transverse and longitudinal wave.
Only the direction of propagation i.e. the direction of the movement of the particles differs in case of transverse and longitudinal waves.
We have considered only the motion along the horizontal direction i.e. x-axis. i.e. motion of all the peaks and which is a motion of a straight line.
Displacement takes place along the straight line along x-axis.
y component does not play much role as it talks about the movement of particles of the medium.
When we are considering the peaks as a result phase does not have any role. That is phase is constant.
y/a=sin(kx – ωt) => sin-1 (y/a) = (kx- ωt )
=> x=(1/k)sin-1 (y/a) +ωt/k (where (1/k)sin-1 (y/a)  is constant)
=> Speed V=dx/dt =ω/k
(By differentiating with time,(1/k)sin-1 (y/a) = 0 as differentiating a constant term is 0.)

"The principle of superposition of waves

Principle of superposition of waves describes how the individual waveforms can be algebraically added to determine the net waveform.
Waveform tells about the overall motion of the wave.It does not tell about individual particles of the wave.
Suppose we have 2 waves and
Example of superposition of waves is Reflection of waves.
Mathematically: -
Case1:-

Consider 2waves which are in phase with each other. They have the same amplitude, same angular frequency, and same angular wave number.
If wave 1 is represented by y1(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
Wave 2 is also represented by y2(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
By the principle of superposition the resultant wave (2a sin (kx – ωt)) will also be in phase with both the individual waves but the amplitude of the resultant wave will be more.




Case2:-

Consider when the two waves are completely out of phase.i.e. φ = π
If wave 1 is represented by y1(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
Wave 2 is represented by y2(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt+ π).
=>y2=asin(π-(-kx+ ωt) =>y2=-a sin(kx- ωt)
Therefore by superposition principle y=y1+y2=0
 



Case 3:-

Consider when the two waves partially out of phase φ>0 ; φ<π
If wave 1 is represented by y1(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
Wave 2 is represented by y2(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt+ φ).
Therefore by the principle of superposition of waves ,y = y1+ y2
=a[sin(kx-ωt)+sin(kx – ωt+ φ]
y=2a cos (φ/2) sin (kx – ωt + (φ/2))
( By using the formula sinA +sinB=2sin(A+B)/2) cos(A-B)/2)
Amplitude = 2a cos (φ/2) and Phase will be determined by (φ/2).","Definition, Formula, Relation, Reasoning",Grade_11_Physics_Data
"Reflection of waves

Reflection of waves is the change in the direction of a wave upon striking the interface between two materials.

When a wave strikes any interface between any two mediums the bouncing back of wave is termed as reflection of waves.

Interface can be categorised into 2 types:

Open boundary: - When a wave strikes an interface in case of open boundary it will get reflected as well as refracted.
Closed boundary or a rigid boundary: - When a wave is incident on an interface it will completely get reflected. Example:-Wave striking wall(echo)
Reflection at rigid boundary

Consider a string which is fixed to the wall at one end. When an incident wave hits a wall,it will exerta force on the wall.
By Newton’s third law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force of equal magnitude on the string.
Since the wall is rigid wall won’t move, therefore no wave is generated at the boundary.This implies the amplitude at the boundary is 0.
As both the reflected wave and incident wave are completely out of phase at the boundary.Therefore φ=π.
Therefore, yi(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt),
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx + ωt + π) = – a sin (kx + ωt)
By superposition principle y= yi + yr =0
Conclusion: -
The reflection at the rigid body will take place with a phase reversal of π or 180.
Reflection at open boundary

The reflection at an open boundary will take place without any phase change.
In this case at boundary pulse is generated.Therefore amplitude at the boundary is maximum.
This means the reflected wave and incident wave are in phase with each other.As a result the phase difference φ=0.
Therefore, yi(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt),
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt).By superposition principle y= yi + yr =2a sin (kx – ωt)

"Standing (Stationary) Waves

A stationary wave is a wave which is not moving,i.e. it is at rest.
When two waves with the same frequency,wavelengthand amplitude travelling in opposite directions will interfere they produce a standing wave.
 



Conditions to have a standing wave:- Two travelling waves can produce a standing wave, if the waves are moving in opposite directions and they have the same amplitude and frequency.
At certain instances when the peaksof both the waves will overlap. Then both the peaks will add up to form the resultant wave.
At certain instances when the peak of the one wave combine with the negative of the second wave .Then the net amplitude will become 0.
As a result a standing wave is produced. In case of stationary wave the waveformdoes not move.
Explanation:-
Consider Ist wave in the figure and suppose we have a rigid wall which does not move. When anincident wave hits the rigid wall it reflects back with a phase difference of π.
Consider IInd wave in the figure, when the reflected wave travels towards the left there is another incident wave which is coming towards right.
The incident wave is continuously coming come from left to right and the reflected wave will keep continuing from right to left.
At some instant of time there will be two waves one going towards right and one going towards left as a result these two waves will overlap and form a standing wave.
Mathematically:
Wave travelling towards left yl(x,t) =a sin(kx– ωt) and towards right yr(x,t) =a sin (kx + ωt)
The principle of superposition gives, for the combined wave
y (x, t) = yl(x, t) + yr(x, t)= a sin (kx – ωt) + a sin (kx + ωt)
y(x,t)= (2a sin kx) cos ωt (By calculating and simplifying)
The above equation represents the standing wave expression.
Amplitude = 2a sin kx.
The amplitude is dependent on the position of the particle.
The cos ωt represents the time dependent variation or the phase of the standing wave.","Definition, Effects, Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_11_Physics_Data

"Nodes and Antinodes: system closed at both ends

System closed at both ends means both the ends are rigid boundaries.
Whenever there is rigid body there is no displacement at the boundary. This implies at boundary amplitude is always 0. Nodes are formed at boundary.
Standing waves on a string of length L fixed at both ends have restricted wavelength.
This means wave will vibrate for certain specific values of wavelength.
At both ends,nodes will be formed.=>Amplitude=0.
Expression for node x =(nλ)/2.This value is true when x is 0 and L.
When x=L:- L=(nλ)/2 =>λ=(2L)/n ; n=1,2,3,4,…..
λ cannot take any value but it can take values which satisfy λ=(2L)/n this expression.
That is why we can say that the standing wave on a string which is tied on both ends has the restricted wavelength.
As wavelength is restricted therefore wavenumber is also restricted.

At x=L, antinodes will be formed.This means amplitude will be maximum at this end.
Condition for formation of antinodes is x= (n+ (1/2)) (λ/2).=>L=(n+ (1/2)) (λ/2)

Beats is the phenomenon caused by two sound waves of nearly same frequencies and amplitudes travelling in the same direction.

For example:-

Mathematically

Consider only the time dependent and not the position dependent part of the wave.
s1=a cos ω1t and s2=a cos ω2t; where amplitude and phase of the waves are same,but the frequencies are varying. Also considering ω1> ω2.
When these 2 waves superimpose s= s1+ s2=a[cos ω1t + cos ω2t]
By simplifying , 2a (cos(ω1 - ω2)/2)t cos(ω1 + ω2)/2)t)
=>ω1 - ω2 is very small as ω1> ω2.Let (ω1 - ω2 )=ωb
=>ω1 + ω2 is very large. Let (ω1 + ω2 )=ωa
s= 2a cos ωbt cos ωat
cosωat will vary rapidly with time and 2acosωbt will change slowly with time.

"Doppler’s Effect

Doppler Effect is the phenomenon of motion-related frequency change.
Consider if a truck is coming from very far off location as it approaches near our house, the sound increases and when it passes our house the sound will be maximum. And when it goes away from our house sound decreases.
This effect is known as Doppler Effect.
A person who is observing is known as Observer and object from where the sound wave is getting generated it is known as Source.
When the observer and source come nearer to each other as a result waves get compressed. Therefore wavelength decreases and frequency increases.
Case 1:- stationary observer and moving source
Let the source is located at a distance L from the observer.
At any time t1, the source is at position P1.
Time taken by the wave to reach observer =L/v where v=speed of the sound wave.
After some time source moves to position P0 in time T0.
Distance between P1 and P0 =vsTo where vs is the velocity of the source.
Let t2be the time taken by the second wave to reach the observer
Total time taken by the for the second wave to be sent to the observer = To +( L+vsTo)/v
Total time taken by the for the third wave to be sent to the observer=2To +( L+2vsTo)/v
Therefore for nth point tn+1 =nTo +( L+nvsTo)/v
=>In time tn+1the observer captures n waves.
Total time taken by the waves to travel Time period T= (tn+1 - t1)/n
=To +(vsTo)/v =>T=To(1+vs/v)
Or v= 1/T
=>v = v0(1+vs/v)-1
By using binomial Theorem,v= v0 (1- vs/v)
If the source is moving towards the observer the expression will become v= v0 (1+ vs/v)
Case 2:- moving observer and stationary source
As the source is not moving therefore vs is replaced by -v0.

(i) Pushing a door open                 (ii) Man pushing his luggage trolley     (iii) Man hitting a golf ball
Examples of Pull:

Eg 2: In the case of the crane pulling the object, there is an interaction between the crane and the object. The crane is applying force of the object to pull it up.",Example,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"From the above figures, we can understand the following characteristics of Force

Force has both magnitude and direction.
Case (i) Magnitude of forces : F1,F2, Direction of forces: Left to Right (--->)
Case(ii) Magnitude of forces applied: F1,F2.
Direction of force F1 is Left to Right (--->). 
Direction of Force F2 is Right to Left (<---)
More than one force can be applied on an object.
Forces applied in the same direction add up to each other.
If forces are applied in the same direction, the total force adds up in the same direction. In case(i), forces are applied in the same direction. So the total force applied on the 'Heavy Object' is F1+F2 towards Right (--->)
If forces are applied in the opposite direction, then the net force acting on the object is the difference between the forces and the object tends to move in the direction of the greater force.
In case(ii),If F1=F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2=0. The object does not move in any direction.
If F1>F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2. The object moves in the direction of F1 ie towards Right (--->)
If F2>F1, the net force on the object is F = F2-F1. The object moves in the direction of F2 ie towards Left(<---)

"A change in either speed of an object or direction of an object or both is described as a change in its state of motion. Force can change the state of motion of an object.

Let's consider the following sequence of events

A cricket ball is initially at rest.
The bowler picks it up and bowls it towards the batsman.
The batsman hits it with the bat. Subsequently, any of the following events could happen
The batsman hit the ball very hard such that it goes for flying in the air for a six.
The batsman hits the ball such that it goes for a four along the ground.
The batsman hits the ball and the bowler catches it.
The batsman hits a defense shot such that it rolls on the ground for a short distance and stops.
Now from (1) to (2), the ball has changed its speed. Initially, the speed for 0 m/s (at rest) and then the bowler flings it. So, now it moves with a certain speed. When the batsman hits the ball, according to the force applied on the ball, the direction or speed or both change. Any one of the events (a),(b),(c),(d) occurs. When the strike is very hard and upwards, it goes for a six(3a). When the strike is reasonably hard and along the ground, it goes for a four (3b). When the bowler catches it (3c), the bowler has applied has applied a force on it to stop it.

The measure of amount or strength of force is called the magnitude of force. Thus, strength or amount of force is expressed in terms of magnitude.",Definition,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Condition when more than two forces are applied over an object:
Forces applied in same direction:
When more than one force is applied in the same direction, the total force is the magnitude of both the forces.
Example – It is difficult to push a car by single person, but two or more persons can collectively push the same car easily. This is because when more than one person tries to push the car, magnitudes of forces applied by each of the person are summed up and applied over than car, and car is pushed easily because of greater magnitude of force.
That means if three units of force are applied over an object by each of the two persons,
The total unit of force = sum of both forces = 3 unit + 3 unit = 6 unit
Forces applied in opposite direction:
When two forces are applied over an object from opposite directions, the total effective force is the difference of two forces.
(a) When two persons are pushing a box in opposite directions and the magnitude of both the forces is equal, then box will not move, because the difference of two forces will be equal to zero.
Let a person applying 4 unit of force in one direction and other person is also applying 4 unit of force in opposite direction on the same wooden box.
Therefore, the magnitude of total force = 4 unit – 4 unit = 0
(b) If one person is applying a force of 4 unit in one direction and another person is applying a force of 6 unit in opposite direction,
Then total magnitude of force = 6 unit – 4 unit = 2 unit

"Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, Why does this make your hands warmer? The answer is friction.","Reasoning, Causes",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Why Friction Occurs
Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye make look rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in the Figure below. The aluminum foil is so smooth that it's shiny. However, when highly magnified, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy. All those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal. This creates friction.
","Causes, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Factors that Affect Friction
Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. That's why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads. Increasing the area of surfaces that are touching also increases the friction between them. That's why you can't slide as far across ice with shoes as you can on the thin blades of skates. The greater surface area of the soles of the shoes cause more friction and slow you down.","Causes, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Heavier objects also have more friction. Can you explain why?Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this causes greater friction between them.","Causes, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Friction Produces Heat
You know that friction produces heat. That's why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy. This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure below. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem. It can cause the car to overheat.","Effects, Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.","Causes, Reasoning, Effects",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Friction is always parallel to the surface in contact.
In some cases, friction is desirable while in other cases, friction reduces the effectiveness of machines. Without friction, you would not be able to walk, the wheels on a vehicle would have no grip on a road surfacing and the vehicle would not be able to move forward.On the other hand, friction is undesirable in most of the cases. Friction causes mechanical parts to seize and wear out.","Causes, Reasoning, Effects",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Types of Friction
Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact. There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction (Air/Viscous friction). Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces. Fluid friction occurs in liquids and gases.","Types, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Static Friction
Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For example, if you are hiking in the woods, there is static friction between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see Figure below). Without this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difficult to walk. In fact, that's exactly what happens if you try to walk on ice. That's because ice is very slippery and offers very little friction.","Reasoning, Causes, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Can you think of other examples of static friction?
One example is the friction that helps the girls climb the rock wall in the picture above. Static friction keeps their hands and feet from slipping.","Example, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Sliding Friction
Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than static friction. That's why it's easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place. Sliding friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you write with a pencil. The pencil ""lead"" slides easily over the paper, but there's just enough friction between the pencil and paper to leave a mark.","Defintion, Property, Example, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"How does sliding friction help you ride a bike?
There is sliding friction between the brake pads and bike rims each time you use your bike's brakes. This friction slows the rolling wheels so you can stop.","Reasoning, Example",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Rolling Friction
Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates, scooters, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction. You can see what they look like in the Figure below. They let parts of a wheel or other machine roll rather than slide over on another.","Definition, Property, Examples, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data

Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a fluid. A fluid is a substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you've ever tried to push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you've experienced fluid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water against your hand. Look at the skydiver in the Figure below. He's falling toward Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the air against the parachute slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the fluid friction resisting its motion. That's why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver's body.","Definition, Property, Examples, Reasoning, Causes",Grade_8_Physics_Data

"Methods of Increasing and Reducing Friction
In real life, there are circumstances where we have to increase the friction and minimize the friction. Friction can be increased by increasing the roughness of the surfaces in contact. For example, treading of shoes and tires is done to increase friction. When friction is undesirable we have to reduce the friction. Friction can be minimized by using lubricants like oil and grease and by using ball bearing between machine parts. A substance that is introduced between two surfaces in contact, to reduce friction, is called a lubricant. Fluid friction can be minimized by giving suitable shapes to the objects moving in the fluids.","Effects, Property, Reasoning, Definition",Grade_8_Physics_Data

The minimum force that is required to keep a moving object in motion at a constant speed is called sliding friction. Sliding friction is always less than static friction. Due to this, it is easier to push a moving box compared to pushing a static box.

"Factors affecting Friction:
(i) Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact.
(ii) Even those surfaces which appear very smooth but microscopic view show those irregularities. When these surfaces come into contact, the irregularities of surfaces get interlocked.

Vibrations travel through a medium such as air and reach our ears where they are interpreted by the brain as sound.
Human beings are capable of producing sound which originates from the larynx or the voice box in the neck. The sound produced is controlled by thin membranous structures known as vocal cords that stretch across the larynx.

"Introduction
Sound is a form of energy and it comes from vibrations. These vibrations create sound waves which move through mediums such as air and water before reaching our ears. Understand how sound waves come from vibrations in the form of compression and rarefaction and how your ears give you the ability to hear them.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"The difference between Musical sound and noise - Music is produced by periodic vibrations, having regular wave pattern e.g. sound of musical instruments. Noise is produced by irregular vibrations, having irregular wave pattern. e.g.. sound produced by moving vehicle.","Definition, Example",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Learn about the characteristics of sound
•   Loudness-It distinguishes between loud and feeble sound
•   Pitch-It distinguishes between shriller and flatter sound.
•   Timbre or quality-It distinguishes one sound from other having same loudness and pitch.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Learn about free(natural ) vibrations - When we strike the keys of a piano, various strings set in vibrations at their natural frequencies in absence of any external force on it. Damped vibrations - When a body is made to vibrate in a medium, the amplitude of vibrating body continuously decreases with time and ultimately body stops vibrating. Such vibrations are called the damped vibrations.","Definition, Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"When we want to tune a radio or TV set, we merely adjust the values of electronic components to produce vibrations of frequency equal to that of radio waves which we want to receive. Learn how this matching is done due to resonance. Resonance is the phenomenon when the frequency of an applied periodic force is equal to its the natural frequency, the body readily begins to vibrate with an increased amplitude. Understand the conditions of resonance and forced vibrations.","Definition, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Sound needs a medium to propagateThe traveling of sound is called propagation of sound. Sound cannot propagate in the absence of a medium. The place where there is no air or air is removed, is called vacuum. Sound does not propagate (travels) through vacuum.Sound travels through solid, liquid and gas.We usually hear sound which comes to us through air.Aquatic animals communicate as sound travels through water also.We hear the sound through ear","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Vibrations Produce soundHow is sound produced? From loudspeakers to guitars, all sound-producing devices share one common feature: vibration. The amount of vibration, as well as the speed of the vibration, produce the different sounds our ears can recognize.In this blog post, weï¿½ll look at the science behind sound and study how instruments like the guitar and piano create sound. We'll also look at how modern hi-fi systems produce sound, as well as factors that can affect the clarity of sound.","Causes, Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"In simple terms, sound is vibration. The complex internal structure of our ears can respond to the waves produced by vibration, whether in the form of bass drum or an acoustic guitar.",Reasoning,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"When an instrument produces vibrations, it creates oscillating sound waves. Some of these waves are audible to humans, while others are very deep or high-pitched, and fall outside the human range of hearing.",Property,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"A variety of metrics are used to measure soundï¿½s intensity, volume and pitch. The pitch of sound is measures in hertz. One hertz (Hz) refers to the complete cycle of sound waves per second. Thus, 5,000Hz is equal to 5,000 cycles per second.",Property,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"The human ear can generally perceive sound between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. Animals can often hear sound that humans canï¿½t. For example, dogs can hear sounds at very high frequencies ï¿½ often above 20,000Hz ï¿½ but cannot hear low frequency sounds.","Property, Examples",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"All sound is created through vibration. In fact, some people can perceive sounds by focusing solely on the vibration an instrument creates. Ludwig van Beethoven, who famously went deaf late in his life, continued to compose by using the vibration of his piano to ï¿½listenï¿½ to his compositions.","Causes, Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Sound requires two components to be audible to the human ear: vibration, as well as amplification. Amplification can be provided by physical devices like the hollow body of a guitar, or by electrical hi-fi systems and speakers.",Property,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Letï¿½s start with the guitar. Acoustic guitars produce sound through the vibration of their strings. This sound is amplified by the guitarï¿½s hollow body, and the different strings each produce a different frequency ï¿½ and thus different pitch ï¿½ of sound.
The neck of a guitar contains anywhere from 12 to 24 frets. By pressing on each of these frets, the player changes the tension of the string, leading to a new frequency and a different pitch of note or chord.","Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"On a piano, sound is created in almost exactly the same way. Instead of plucking the strings, piano players push keys which trigger hammers that push the strings inside the piano. The body of the piano amplifies this sound just like the body of a guitar.","Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"While other instruments use different methods to create vibration and sound waves, the principles are the same: sound waves are created through vibration, and pitch is manipulated by changing the frequency of the vibration and sound waves","Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"If youï¿½ve ever taken the protective covers off a pair of hi-fi speakers, youï¿½ll know that they vibrate when you play music. Speakers produce sound using vibration, just like a piano or guitar. However, the design of speakers lets them create a far wider range of sounds than a piano or guitar could produce.","Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Instead of using human energy to create vibration, like the plucking motion used to play a guitar or the tap of a piano keyï¿½s hammer, speakers convert electrical energy into vibration which, in turn, produces sound. Digital audio production software often includes a live view of sound waves as they are playing. The peaks in this view are the periods at which sound is loudest. This is when your speakers will be vibrating the most.","Property, Reasoning",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Most speakers include several different speaker drivers, each of which can produce sounds of a certain frequency. The most common speaker drivers include tweeters, mid-range, woofers, and subwoofers",Property,Grade_8_Physics_Data

"Applications of Electroplating

Artificial jewelry, usually made of less expensive metals is often plated with a thin layer of a precious metal like gold and silver to make it more lustrous, appealing but cheaper.

Many industrial applications use electroplating to create a protective barrier on a metal substrate. The protective barrier in this case prevents tarnishing and gives a glossy appearance. Eg: Chromium plating is done on car spare parts, taps, wheel rims etc. Chromium is very expensive and the whole part cannot be made of chromium. So, it is coated with chromium to give it a shiny appearance.

Tinning (electroplating of tin) is a very cost-effective electroplating solution. Tin is relatively cheaper  and is used for electroplating electronic components, hardware products, fasteners, screws, nuts, bolts and food cans. If food is stored in iron cans, it would tend to get spoilt over a period of time. But, when iron is electroplated with tin, it prevents the food from getting spoilt. Tinning offers resistance against corrosion

Zinc electroplating offers excellent adhesion and resistance to corrosion. So, it is used to electroplate automobile parts and body, transmission components, defense carriers and tanks.

When we rubbed the comb on our hair, the electrons were transfered from hair to the comb. Now the comb is charged negatively.
When the comb is brought near the pieces of paper, the electric field of the comb influences the paper and it gets polarised ie the positive charges move near the comb and the negative charges on the other side of the comb. And hence they attract each other.

If the charged body was brought close to the electroscope and then, we simultaneously touch the metal plates with your hand, then this would cause the charges to flow through your body ( your body is a good condutor of electricity) to the ground.

In this process, the charges also gets separated ie the positive charges accumulate near the upper layers of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower layers.
On the ground, positive charges accumulate.
The magnitude of these charges grow larger and larger with time and intense rainfall.
Under such circumstances, air (which normally is a poor conductor of electricity), loses its resistance to electricity and begins to conduct.
When the air begins to conduct, the positive charges on the ground, meets the negative charges on the cloud and streaks of light is produced. This light an electric discharge and we see and call this as Lightning.

Human Eye 
Let's understand how the human eye helps us in seeing objects. The eye is roughly spherical in shape.
Light mainly falls on the cornea - the white clear front part of the eye. It is tough and protects the interior of the eye from accidents.
The iris (a muscular structure behind the cornea) of the eye controls the amount of light reaching the interior of the eye by automatically adjusting the size of the pupil. (The iris is that part of the eye which gives it the colour such as black, brown, green eyes commonly called cat-eyes etc)
The eye's crystalline biconvex shaped lens is located behind the pupil. It further focuses the light on the retina. The retina contains several nerve cells which convert the optical images to signals to the brain via the optic nerve.
There are 2 types of nerve cells. (i) Cones : which are sensitive to bright light and help us recognize color (ii) Rods: which are sensitive to dim light.
The brain then decodes this signal as the image we see!
Note : The light is focused by the cornea, then the iris by controlling the opening of the pupil and then the lens. In dim light, your pupil expands to allow more light to enter your eye. In bright light, it contracts.

 When light travels from a rarer (eg. Air) to a denser (eg. Glass) medium it bends towards the normal.
 When light travels from a denser to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal.
 When light travel along the normal there is no deviation that is the ray suffers no refraction.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Refraction of light through a Prism
A prism is a transparent solid body, often having triangular bases. When three rectangular surface that it forms two triangular faces at opposite ends, they form prism. The triangular faces are called the principal faces of the prism","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Dispersion
The splitting up of light into its constituent colours is called dispersion. Sunlight is a mixture of light of several colours. It is known as white light. When white light passes through a prism, dispersion takes place because rays of different colours are deviated through different angles by a prism. Violet is deviated the most and red the least.
 The band of colours obtain because of dispersion of light is called a spectrum.
 The spectrum of sunlight consists of violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.

The rainbow is a very beautiful natural spectrum on a large scale. It is formed in the direction opposite to the sun. When there is moisture in the air the tiny droplets of water acts as prisms and disperse sunlight.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Human Eye
The eye is natural optical instrument that forms an image of objects on a screen called the retina. This enables us to see to objects.
 The front part of the eye is called the cornea and is made up of a transparent material.
 Behind the cornea is the iris the coloured parts of the eye.
 In the middle of the iris is a hole called the pupil? It appears black because no light is reflected from it.
 The iris adjusts the amount of light entering the eye through pupil.
 Behind the iris is a convex lens. The eye lens is held in position by a pair of muscles called ciliary muscles.
 The lens forms an Image of an object on the retina which is at the back of the eye.
 The retina is covered by a large number of nerve cells sensitive to light which carry the impression to the brain by means of optic nerve.
 There are two kinds of nerve cells on retina-
 Cones – that sense colour & are sensitive to bright light.
 Rods – which are sensitive to dim light","Definition, Property, Types",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Power of accommodation of Eye
The ciliary muscles alter the thickness of the lens enabling the eye to see far and near objects equally clearly.
The ability of eye to adjust itself to see objects at different distances clearly is called the power of accommodation of the eye.
 The least distance at which eye can clearly see an object is called the near point or the least distance of distinct vision.
 The far point of the eye is the maximum distance to which the eye can see. For a normal eye it is at infinity.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"The blind spot
There is one point on the retina where the nerve fibers enter the optic nerve. The image falling on this part of the retina cannot be seen and hence it is known as the blind spot.
",Definition,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Persistence of Vision
To see and object, its image must be formed on the retina by the eye lens. As soon as the object is removed, the image disappears but the brain remembers the image for 1/10th of a second even after the removal of object. This effect is called Persistence of vision.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Defects of vision and their correction
The two common \defects of the eye are short- sightedness or myopia, and long – sightedness or hyper- metropia or hyperopic.
",Types,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Myopia (Short – sightedness)
 Myopia is a defect of the eye in which distant objects cannot be seen clearly but nearby objects can be seen clearly.
 To correct this defect, a diverging or concave lens is used to create an extra divergence so that the images get formed on the retina.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Hypermetropia (Long- sightedness) 
 Hypermetropia is a defect of the eye in which distant objects can be seen clearly by the eye but nearby objects cannot be seen distinctly.
 This defect is because the focal length of the eye lens too long or the eyeball is too short. As a result, nearby objects are brought to focus at a point behind the retina.
 The defect of Hypermatropia may be corrected by using a converse or converging lens since the rays require an extra convergence to meet at a lesser distance.
","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Cataract
This is another defect of the eye generally occurring at old eye. In a person suffering from cataract, the eye lens becomes cloudy leading to loss of vision.

 Avoid watching TV or working on a computer for long sessions.",Reasoning,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Light: Light is a form of energy. It helps in the sense of vision. When light falls on an object, some of the light is reflected back to our eyes. Thus, we are able to see an object because of light being reflected from the object.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"When light falls on a shiny surface, most of it bounces back. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Laws of Reflection
There are two laws of reflection which are as follows:

First Law of Reflection: The incident ray, the reflecting ray and normal at the point of incidence; all lie in the same plane.

Second Law of Reflection: Angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. In the given figure; the angle of incidence is shown by blue colour and the angle of reflection is shown by red colour.",Property,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Formation of Image in plane Mirror
Some features of image formed by a plane mirror:
Image is always formed behind the mirror.
It is a virtual image; which means it cannot be obtained on screen.
Image is upright and laterally inverted.
Image size and distance are equal to object size and distance.",Property,Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Regular Reflection
When all the reflected rays are parallel to each other; this case of reflection is called regular reflection. Regular reflection happens from a smooth surface, e.g. a mirror. We get to see clear images when image is formed by regular reflection.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Irregular Reflection
When the reflected rays are not parallel to each other; this case of reflection is called irregular reflection. Irregular reflection happens from a rough surface. The laws of reflection are obeyed in this case as well but because of the irregularities in the surface, the reflected rays are not parallel. We get to see somewhat blurred images when image is formed by irregular reflection. The relative clarity of an image depends on the relative smoothness of the reflecting surface.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Multiple Images: When two or more mirrors are placed at some angles to each other, we get to see multiple images. Let us take an example in which two mirrors are placed opposite to each other. If an object is placed between them, its image is formed in both the mirrors. The image in one mirror would act as an object for another mirror and this sequence would continue. This will result in the formation of multiple images.

The number of images formed depends on the angle between the two mirrors. This can be calculated by using the following formula:

Number of Images = (360/Angle) – 1

So, if the given mirrors are at a right angle to each other, 3 images will be formed. If the given mirrors are at 30° angle, we shall get 11 images. When the mirrors are kept opposite and parallel to each other, there would be infinite number of images formed.","Property, Formula, Relation",Grade_8_Physics_Data

"Blind Spot: The junction of retina and the optic nerve is called the blind spot. There is no photosensitive cell at this spot, and hence no image is formed at this spot on the retina.","Definition, Property",Grade_8_Physics_Data
"Persistence of Vision
An image stays on the retina for about 1/16 of a second. This feature is called persistence of vision. Due to this, when many still images are shown in a sequence; they give the illusion of moving images. Movies and animation are made by exploiting this property of the human eye.","Definition, Property, Effects",Grade_8_Physics_Data

"The property of light to travel in straight lines explains many interesting phenomena related to light, like formation of shadows by opaque objects and formation of images in a pin-hole camera.",Property,Grade_6_Physics_Data
"Shadows :

An opaque object blocks the light falling on it. This creates an area of darkness on the side of the object away from the source of light. A translucent object also creates a faint area of darkness.

"Reflection Surfaces :
We say light is reflected when it bounces off a surface. Reflection of light helps us to see most of the things around us.
Reflection of light by a surface depends on the nature of the surface. A rough and bumpy surface (also called an irregular surface) reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in different directions (Fig.

Electric current flows only if there is an unbroken path or closed circuit starting from one terminal of the source, through the torch bulb, to the other terminal of the source. Thus, the bulb glows in Figure 14.6(b) but not in Figure 14.6(a). The circuit in Figure 14.6(a) is not complete. Hence, current cannot flow through the circuit and the bulb does not glow.
