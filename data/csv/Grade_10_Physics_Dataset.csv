"Human Eye
It is one of the sensitive sense organs present in living organisms. It acts like a Camera.","Defintion, Property"
"The image is formed on light sensitive screen known as Retina.

Thin membrane through which light enters the eye is known as Cornea.

The eyeball is spherical in shape.","Reasoning, Property"
"Presence of the crystalline lens helps in adjusting objects at different distances on the retina.

The dark muscular structure that controls the size of the pupil is known as Iris. Thus, pupil regulates the amount of light entering the eye.

Real, inverted image is formed on the retina. Retina contain light sensitive cells known as Rods and Cons. The light sensitive cells send signals to the brain via optic nerve.","Property, Reasoning"
"Power of Accommodation
Focal lens of the eye lens can be decreased or increased. The lens become thin when the muscles are relaxed. This increases the focal length. This helps to see the distant objects. Similarly, when the eye lens become thick, focal length decreases and we are able to see nearby objects.

So, power of accommodation is defined as ability of the lens to adjust the focal length.",Definition
"The minimum distance at which the particular object can be seen clearly is known as least distance of distinct vision. This is also called Near Point of the Eye. For young individuals, near point is about 25 cm. The farthest point to which an object can be seen is known as Far Point of the Eye. This is about 25 cm to infinity.","Defintion, Property"
"In old age people, the lens becomes milky and cloudy, this is known as Cataract. This can leads to complete or partial loss of vision.",Property
"The three common defects of vision are as follows-

Myopia (also known as Near Sightedness). In this case, distant objects cannot be seen clearly but nearby objects are clearly visible. Image is not formed on the retina, instead it is formed in front of the retina. Using concave lens of suitable power can be used to correct this defect.","Types, Definition"
"Hypermetropia also known as Far-sightedness. Nearby objects are not seen clearly whereas distant objects can be seen clearly. Image is formed behind the retina instead on the retina. Convex lens of appropriate power can be used to correct this defect.

",Defintion
"Presbyopia is defined as the one in which power of accommodation decreases with ageing. They have difficulty in near vision. Ciliary muscles get weakened and the flexibility of the eye lens gets diminished. Generally, bifocal lens are used for correcting the defects.",Definition
"The band of these seven colours formed because of dispersion of light is known as Spectrum.

",Definition
"Total Internal Reflection
When a light passes from denser to rarer medium and angle of incidence is greater than critical angle, the light will reflect in the denser medium. This is known as Total Internal Reflection",Definition
"Condition for Total Internal Reflection
Light should pass from denser to rarer medium

Angle of incidence should be greater than the critical angle.

Critical angle is defined as angle of incidence for which angle of refraction is 90 degrees",Property
"Atmospheric Refraction
Twinkling of Stars

When star light enters the atmosphere, it undergoes refraction. Due to this refractive index changes as the light bends towards the normal. The apparent position of the stars appears slightly different from the actual position. Since the physical conditions of the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, the apparent positions of stars keep on changing. That is why they appear to twinkle.

Advance Sunlight and Delayed Sunset

The sun is visible 2 minutes before the actual sunrise or sunset appears 2 minutes after the actual sunset has taken place is due to atmospheric refraction.","Property, Definition"
"Tyndall Effect
When beam of light strikes tiny water droplets, suspended particles of dust etc.(called as Colloidal Particles), the path of the beam becomes visible. This is known as Tyndall Effect. The colour of scattered light depends upon the size of colloidal particles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.","Defintion, Property"
"Why sky appears blue in colour?
The colour of the sky appears blue due to scattering of light. When the sunlight passes through the atmosphere, fine particles in air will scatter the blue colour more strongly than red.

",Reasoning
"Why sky appears red in colour during sunrise and sunset?
During sunrise and sunset, light from the Sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air and larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes. Light from the Sun overhead would travel relatively shorter distance, resulting in white appearance of sun. Near the horizon, most of the blue light and shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelengths, hence the reddish appearance.",Reasoning
Construction of human eye The outermost black part of the eye is called cornea. The iris is present behind it. The hole present in the iris is called pupil. Behind this a crystalline lens is present which is held by ciliary muscles. The retina is the innermost part of the eye which is connected by the optic nerves. The liquid present between the iris and the eye lens is called aqueous humour and the liquid present between the eye lens and the retina is called vitreous humour.,"Defintion, Property"
"Functions of
Cornea It refracts the light falling on it.
Iris. Iris controls the size of the pupil.
Pupil. It controls the amount of light entering the eye.
Crystalline lens. It is a convex lens which converges the light rays coming from the object to form an image on retina.
Ciliary muscles. They hold the lens and change its focal length by pressing or stretching it.
Retina. It is a delicate membrane having light sensitive cells which generate electrical impulses.","Defintion, Property"
Working of eye The light falling on the eye gets refracted through the cornea. This amount of light is controlled by the pupil. The eye lens converges the light rays and forms an image on the retina. The focal length of the lens is controlled by the ciliary muscles. Retina converts the light rays into electrical signals which are sent by optic nerves to the brain. The brain interprets these signals and we see the objects as it is.,Property
Power of accommodation. The ability of an eye to focus the distant objects as well as nearby objects on the retina clearly by changing the focal length of lens is called power of accommodation. A normal eye has a power of accommodation which enables the objects as far as infinity and as close as 25 cm to be focused on retina.,Defintion 
"Eye lens. An eye lens is composed of fibrous jelly like material. Its focal length can be changed by ciliary muscles by pressing or stretching it. To increase the focal length, the ciliary muscles are in the relaxed position and the lens is thin.","Property, Definiton"
"Near point or least distance of distinct vision. The minimum distance at which an object placed can be seen clearly without strain is called near point or least distance of distinct vision. For a healthy human eye, near point is 25 cm.",Defintion
Far point The farthest point up to which the eye can see the object clearly is called the far point of the eye. The far point for a healthy human eye is at infinity.,Defintion
Cataract The condition in which the lens of the eye of a person becomes cloudy and milky resulting in blurred vision is called cataract.,Defintion
Cause of formation of cataract Cataract develops when the eye lens of a person becomes cloudy due to the formation of a membrane of proteins over it.,Property
"Reason of having two eyes for vision.
Two eyes give a wider field of view.
Two eyes enable us to judge the distance more accurately.",Reasoning
"Defects of vision

Myopia or near sightedness short sightedness The defect of vision in which a person can see the nearby objects clearly but is unable to see the distant objects clearly is called short sightedness or myopia. In the myopic eye the image of the distant object is formed in front of the retina.",Property
The human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us.,Defintion
The eyeball is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of about 2.3 cm.,Property
Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The crystalline lens merely provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus.,Property
" The human eye has the following parts :

Cornea : The transparent spherical membrane covering the front of the eye.
Iris: The coloured diaphragm between the cornea  and lens.
Pupil: The small hole in the iris.
Eye lens : It is a transparent lens made of jelly like material.
Ciliary muscles: These muscles hold the lens in position.
Retina: The back surface of the eye.
Blind spot: The point at which the optic nerve leaves the eye. An image formed at this point is not sent to the brain.
Aqueous humour: A clear liquid region between the cornea and the lens.
Vitreous humour: The space between eye lens and retina is filled with another liquid called vitreous humour.","Types, Relation, Defintion"
" In the eye, the image is formed on the retina by successive refractions at the cornea, the aqueous humour, the lens and the vitreous humour. Electrical signals then travel along the optic nerve to the brain to be interpreted. In good light, the yellow spot is most sensitive to detail and the image is automatically formed there.",Property
"Accommodation: The ability of the eye to focus both near and distant objects, by adjusting its focal length, is called the accommodation of the eye or the ability of the ciliary muscles to change the focal length of the eye lens is called accommodation.",Defintion
"Defects of the Eye : Although the eye is one of the most remarkable organs in the body, it may have several abnormalities, which can often be corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery. The various defects from which an eye can suffer are (i) Hypermetropia or long sightedness, (ii) Myopia or shortsightedness and (iii) Astigmatism, (iv) Presbyopia.",Property
" Hypermetropia, hyperopia, or long sightedness : A person suffering from this defect can see distant objects I clearly but cannot see nearby objects clearly. In this defect, the near point lies farther away than 25 cm. Hypermetropia (far sightedness — the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond the retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power. The eye loses
its power of accommodation at old age.",Definition
"Hypermetropia is due to the following reasons :

Either the hyperopic eyeball is too short or
The ciliary muscle is unable to change the shape
of the lens enough to properly focus the image i.e. the focal length of the eye lens increases.",Reasoning
Myopia or short sightedness or near sightedness: A person suffering frommyopia or short sightedness can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see the far away objects clearly. Myopia (short sightedness — the image of distant objects is focussed before the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power.,"Defintion, Property"
"This defect is due to the following reasons :

Either the eyeball is longer than normal or
The maximum focal length (due to excessive curvature of the cornea) of the lens is insufficient to produce a clearly formed image on the retina.",Reasoning
"A person may also have an eye defect known as astigmatism, in which light from a point-source produces a line image on the retina. A person suffering from this defect cannot see in all directions equally well i.e., he cannot see the vertical and horizontal lines simultaneously. This condition arises either when the cornea or the crystalline lens or both are not perfectly spherical. Astigmatism can be corrected with lenses having different curvatures in two mutually perpendicular directions i.e., cylindrical lens.",Definition
"When a person suffers from both, the myopia as well as Hypermetropia, his spectacles for correction have bifocal lenses. The upper half is a concave lens for distant vision and lower half is a convex lens for reading.","Property, Reasoning"
"Presbyopia is that defect of human eye, due to which an old person cannot read and write comfortably. That is why Presbyopia is also called old sight.
 To correct Presbyopia, an old person has to use spectacles with a convex lens of suitable focal length, or power as explained already.","Defintinon, Property"
"The cause of Hypermetropia is decrease in length of eyeball or increase In focal length of eye lens. But the cause of Presbyopia is only increase in focal length of eye lens. The eyeball, in Presbyopia, has normal length.
the vision of the eye decreases, leading sometimes to total loss of vision. The problem is overcome by cataract surgery i.e., removal of the eye lens, and its replacement by a lens of suitable focal length.","Effects, Property"
"We need two eyes because a human being has a horizontal field of view of about 150° with one eye and of about 180° with two eyes. Thus, two eyes provide us wider horizontal field of view.
With one eye, the world looks flat, i.e., two dimensional only. With two eyes, the view is three dimensional, i.e., dimension of depth is added to our view.",Reasoning
"As our two eyes are separated by a few centimetres, each eye observes a slightly different image. Our brain combines the two views into one and we get to know how close or far away the things seen are.","Reasoning, Property"
" By donating our eyes after we die, one pair of our eyes can give vision to two corneal blind people. Eye donors may belong to any sex or any age group. People suffering from diabetes, hypertension, asthma or any other non- communicable diseases can donate eyes. People who have been using spectacles or those operated for cataract can also donate eyes.",Reasoning
"The smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is called the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision. For a young adult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.",Definition
"Persistence of vision of the eye: The image of an object persists on the retina for 1/16 second, even after the removal of the object. The sequence of still pictures taken by a movie camera is projected on a screen at a rate of about 24 images or more per second. The successive impressions of images on the screen appear to merge smoothly into one another to give us the feeling of moving images.","Reasoning, Property"
"The large numbers of light sensitive cells contained in the retina of the eye are of two types: rod shaped cells which respond to brightness or intensity of light and cone shaped cells, which respond to colour of light. Thus/cone shaped cells enable us to distinguish between different colours.","Types, Definition"
"When a person cannot distinguish between different colours, he is said to be colour blind though his vision may otherwise be normal. Colour blindness is a genetic disorder which occurs by inheritance. So far, there is no cure for colour blindness.","Defintion, Property"
". Farpoint: The farthest point upto which a short sighted eye can see clearly is called the far point of the eye. For a normal eye, the far point is infinity.",Defintion
"Near point : The nearest point upto which a long sighted eye can see clearly is called the near point of the eye. For a normal human eye, of an adult, the near point is about 25 cm from the eye.",Definition
"Least cfistance of distinct vision: The minimum distance upto which an eye can see clearly is called the legist distance of distinct vision ; it is normally denoted by D. The least distance of distinct vision is equal to the distance between the eye and its near point. For a normal human eye, this distance is around 25 cm",Definition
The distance between far point and near point of the eye is called range of vision of the eye.,Definition
"When white light passes through a prism, the violet light bends most and the red light bends the least. Dispersion of light is the phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent seven colours on passing through a glass prism. The band of seven colours so obtained is called visible spectrum.","Defition, Property"
"The seven colours of white light are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. It is remembered by the acronym VIBGYOR.

",Types
 Spectrum is the band of distinct colours we obtain when white light is split by a prism.,Definition
"Cause of dispersion : Every colour has its own characteristic wavelength/frequency. Different colours move with same speed in air/vacuum. But their speeds in refracting media like glass are different. Therefore, refractive index of the medium for different colours is different. As a result, different colours undergo different deviations on passing through the prism. Hence, different colours emerge from the prism along different directions.","Causes, Reasoning"
"The speed of light in vacuum is same for all wavelengths, but the speed in a material substance is different for different wavelengths.",Property
 In any medium other than air/vacuum red light travels the fastest and violet light travels the slowest.,Property
" The most familiar form of electromagnetic radiation may be defined as that part of the spectrum that the human eye can detect. Light is produced by the rearrangement of electrons in atoms and molecules. The various wavelengths of visible light are classified with colours ranging from violet (λ = 4 x 10-7 m) to red (λ = 7 x 10-7 m). The eye’s sensitivity is a function of wavelength, the sensitivity being a maximum at a wavelength of about λ = 5.6 x 10-7 m (yellow-green).","Definition, Property"
"When we pass white light through two ideptical prisms held side by side with their refracting edges in opposite directions; the first prism disperses white light into seven colours and the second prism recombines the seven colours into white light. Thus, light emerging from 2nd prism is white.",Reasoning
A rainbow is formed due to dispersion of light by tiny droplets of water which act as prisms.,Causes 
"Atmospheric refraction is the cause of twinkling of stars, advance sunrise and delayed sunset.",Causes
"Scattering of light causes the blue colour of sky and the reddening of the Sun at sunrise and sunset.

"HUMAN EYE :
It acts like a camera, enable us to capture the colourful picture of the surroundings.
An inverted, real image on light sensitive  is formed on the  Retina","Definition, Property"
"The Various Parts of Eye and their Functions
1. Cornea : It is a thin membrane through which light enters. It forms the transparent bulge on the front of eyeball. Most of the refraction occurs at the outer surface of the cornea.
2. Eyeball :it is a convex lens, approximately spherical in shape, with a diameter of about 2.3 cm. It can alter its curvature with help of ciliary muscles.
3. Iris :It is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of pupil.It is behind the cornea.it helps in accommodation of light by changing the size of the pupil.

4. Pupil :It regulates and control the amount of light entering the eye. It is the black opening between aqueous humour& lens.BLack in colour. Light entering cannot exit.

5. Crystalline eye lens :Provides the focused real & inverted image of the object on the retina. It is composed of a fibrous, jelly like material.
This is convex lens that converges light at retina.

6. Ciliary muscles :It helps to change the curvature of eye lens and hence changes its focal length so that we can see the object clearly placed at different positions.

7. Retina : Thin membrane with large no. of light sensitive cells.
There are two types of photoreceptors in the human retina, rods and cones.
Rods are responsible for vision at low light levels . They do not mediate color vision.
Cones are active at higher light levels , are capable of color vision.
When image is formed at retina, light sensitive cells gets activated and generate electrical signal. These signals are sent to brain via optic nerve. Brain analyse these signals after which we perceive object as they are.

8. The vitreous body is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball of humans and other vertebrate

9. The aqueous humour is a transparent, watery fluid similar to plasma, but containing low protein concentrations.","Types, Definition"
"How Pupil Works ?
Example: You would have observed that when you come out of the cinema hall after watching movie, in the bright sun light, your eyes get closed . And when you enter the hall from the bright light, you won’be able to see but after some time you would be able to see.
Here the pupil of an eye provides a variable aperture, whose size is controlled by iris","Reasoning, Effects"
"(a) When the light is bright : Iris contracts the pupil, so that less light enters the eye.

(b) When the light is dim : Iris expand the pupil, so that more light enters the eye.
Pupil opens completely, when iris is relaxed.","Reasoning, Effects"
Persistence of Vision : It is the time for which the sensation of an object continue in the eye. It is about 1/16th of a second.,Definition
"Power of Accommodation
The ability of eye lens to adjust its focal length with the help of ciliary muscles is called accommodation.",Definition
"1. Eye lens becomes thin 1. Eye lens becomes thick
2. Increases the focal length 2. Decreases the focal length
3. Enable us to see distant object clearly 3.Enable us to see nearby object clearly",Effects
"Cataract : The image can not be seen distinctly because eye lens become milky and cloudy. This condition is known as cataract, it can cause complete or partial loss of vision.
This can be corrected by surgical removal of extra growth (cataract surgery).","Defintion, Property"

1. Increase in focal length of the eye lens (Thin eye lens)
2. Eye ball has become too small.",Reasoning
"Correction
Corrected by using a Convex Lens of appropriate power.",Reasoning
"4. Presbyopia

As we become old, the power of accommodation of the eye usually decreases, the near point gradually recedes away. This defect is called Presbyopia, a special kind of Hypermetropia.
Person may suffer from both myopia and hypermetropia.

Reason of defect : Gradual weakening of ciliary muscles and decreasing the flexibility of the eye lens.

Correction : Using Bifocal lens with appropriate power.Bifocal lens consist of both concave and convex lens, upper position consist of concave lens and lower portion consist of convex lens action of Light through a Prism","Defintion, Reasoning"

"Splitting of White Light into Band of Colours

The band of the coloured components of light beam is called Spectrum i.e. VIBGYOR
The splitting of light into its component colours is called Dispersion.
The different component colour of light bends at different angle with respect to incident angle, the red light bends the least while the violet bends most.",Property
"RAINBOW It is the spectrum of sunlight in nature It is formed due to the dispersion of sunlight by the tiny water droplet, present in atmosphere.",Definition
"Water Droplet Act like Prism

It refracts and disperses the incident sunlight, then reflects it internally(internal reflection) and finally refracts it again, when it emerges out of the water droplet.
A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of sun.
Due to dispersion and internal reflection of light, different colours reach he observer’s eye.
Red colour appears on top & violet at the bottom of rainbow","Property, Reasoning"
"Atmospheric Refraction

1. Apparent Star Position : It is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight.
The temperature and density of different layers of atmosphere keeps varying. Hence we have different medium.
Distant star act as point source of light. When the starlight enter the earth’s atmosphere it undergoes refraction continuously, due to changing refractive index i.e. from Rarer to denser, it bends towards the normal.
Due to this the apparent position of the star is different from actual position.
The star appears higher than its actual position.","Definition, Property"
"Distant star act like a point source of light. As the beam of starlight keeps deviating from its path, the apparent position of star keeps on changing because physical condition of earth’s atmosphere is not stationary
Hence the amount of light enters our eyes fluctuate some time bright and sometime faint.
This is the “Twinkling effect of star”.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Blue Sky
The blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of sunlight off the molecules of the atmosphere. This scattering, called Rayleigh scattering, is more effective at short wavelengths (the blue end of the visible spectrum). Therefore the light scattered down to the earth at a large angle with respect to the direction of the sun’s light is predominantly in the blue end of the spectrum.","Definition, Reasoning"

"Representations of the images formed by Spherical Mirrors using Ray Diagrams
We draw the ray diagram to locate the image of an object formed. The intersection point of at least two reflected will give the position of image of the point object. The two rays that can be used to draw the ray diagram are-
A ray parallel to the principal axis should pass through the focus after reflection in case of concave mirror, or appear to diverge in case of convex mirror.
A ray passing through the focus of the concave mirror or directed towards the focus in case of convex mirror, should appear parallel to the principal axis after reflection.
A ray which is passing through the centre of curvature in a concave mirror or directed in case of convex mirror, should reflect along the same path.
A ray when incident obliquely to principal axis on a concave or convex mirror is also reflected obliquely.

"Sign Convention for Spherical Mirror:
Cartesian Sign Convention: In the case of spherical mirror all signs are taken from Pole of the spherical mirror, which is often called origin or origin point. This sign convention is known as New Cartesian Sign Convention.
Sign is taken as – (negative) from pole of a spherical mirror towards object along the principal axis. This means sign is always taken as – (negative) in front of a spherical mirror. For example; the distance of object is always taken as – (negative) in case of both types of spherical mirror, i.e. concave and convex mirrors.
Sign is taken as + (positive) behind the spherical mirror. For example if an image is formed behind the mirror, the distance of image is taken as + (positive) from pole along the principal axis.

"Refraction: Introduction
The change of direction of light because of change of medium is known as Refraction or Refraction of Light. The ray of light changes its direction or phenomenon of refraction takes place because of difference in speed in different media.

The light travels at faster speed in rare medium and at slower speed in denser medium. The nature of media is taken as relative. For example air is a rarer medium than water or glass.

When ray of light enters from a rarer medium into a denser medium, it bends towards normal at the point of incidence. On the contrary, when ray of light enters into a rarer medium from a denser medium it bends away from the normal.

Ray emerging after the denser medium goes in the same direction and parallel to the incident ray

"The angle between incident ray and normal is called Angle of Incidence and it is denoted as ‘i’. The angle between refracted ray and normal is called the Angle of Refraction. Angle of refraction is denoted by ‘r’.

",Definition
"Laws of Refraction:
The incident ray, refracted ray and normal to the interface of given two transparent media, all lie in same plane.
The ratio of sine of angle of incidence and sine of angle of refraction is always constant for the light of given colour and for the pair of given media.
The Second Law of Refraction is also known as Snell’s Law of Refraction.
that is, sini/sinr = constant
The constant is called refractive index of the second medium in relation to the first medium.


","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"A ray of light changes its direction when it enters from one medium to another medium. This happens because speed of light is different in different media. For example; the speed of light is 3 x 108 m/s (2.99x108 m/s) in vacuum and it is 2.98 x 108 m/s in air.

Refractive Index is the extent of change of direction of light in a given pair of media. The refractive index is a relative value of speed of light in the given pair of media. Thus, to calculate the refractive Index the speed of light in two media is taken.

Let the speed of light in medium 1 is v1 and in medium 2 is v2

Therefore; refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 (n21)

n21=v1/v2

Above expression gives the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1. This is generally denoted by n21.

Similarly, the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is denoted by n12.

n12=v2/v1

"Absolute Refractive Index:When one medium is taken as vacuum and speed of light is taken in it, then the refractive index of second medium with respect to vacuum is called Absolute Refractive Index and it is generally denoted by nm.
The speed of light in vacuum is slightly faster than in air. Let speed of light in air is ‘c’ and the speed of light in given medium is ‘v’. Therefore, refractive index of the given medium:

nm=c/v
Since, Refractive Index is the relative value of the speed of light of a medium with respect to the speed of light in vacuum, thus light will travel faster in the medium having lower value of refractive index.

"Some common phenomena of Refraction:
Bending of pencil when placed in a glass with water: When a pencil or stick is kept in a beaker or a glass filled with water, the stick appears slightly bent.

Position of fish in the water of pond: The ray coming from fish in the pond bends away from the normal to the incident. We see the emergent ray which makes the appearance of fish slightly above its position.
Formation of rainbow: Rainbow is formed just after the rain. When ray of light travels from droplets of rain, it is scattered into its constituent seven colours and forms a rainbow in the sky.
Visibility of sun slightly before the time of sunrise: When the rays coming from the sun enter into atmosphere (which is denser medium than vacuum), they bend away from normal to the incidence because of refraction.

Here it is observed that with the change in direction of the flow of current the force of magnet on the conductor also changes. As mentioned above this is because of the SNOW RULE.

When the armature moves within the magnetic field an electric current is induced. The direction of induced current changes, when the armature crosses the halfway mark of its rotation. Thus, the direction of current changes once in every rotation. Due to this, the electric generator usually produces alternate current, i.e. AC. To convert an AC generator into a DC generator, a split ring commutator is used. This helps in producing direct current.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"18. Electromagnetic Induction: Can be explained by two experiments
(a) First Experiment  “Self Induction”

In this experiment, when the north pole of bar magnet is brought closer to the coil or away from the coil, we see momentary deflection in the needle of galvanometer on either side of null point. First right and then left.

Similarly, if we keep the magnet stationary and coil is made to move towards or away from the north pole of magnet. Again we will observe deflection in the needle of galvanometer.

If both bar magnet and coil are kept stationary, there will be no deflection in galvanometer. This experiment can also be done with the south pole of magnet, we will observe the deflection in galvanometer, but it would be in opposite direction to the previous case.

 It concludes that motion of magnet with respect to coil or vice-versa, changes the magnetic field. Due to this change in magnetic field lines, potential difference is induced in the same coil, which set up an induced current in the circuit.

(b) Second Experiment : Mutual Induction

In this experiment plug in the key that connects coil with battery and observe the deflection in galvanometer. Now plug out the key that disconnect the coil-1 from battery and observe the deflection in galvanometer, which will be in reverse direction.

Hence, we conclude that potential difference is induced in secondary coil (coil-2), whenever there is a change in current, in primary coil(coil-1) (by on and off of key).

This is because, whenever there is change in current in primary coil



Magnetic field associated with it also changes



Now, magnetic field lines around the secondary coil (coil-2) will change and induces the electric current in it (observed by the deflection of needle of Galvanometer in secondary circuit)

This process, by which changing of strength of current in primary coil, induces a current in secondary coil is called Electromagnetic Induction”

The induced current is found to be highest when the direction of motion of coil is at right angles to the magnetic field.

"Electric Motor:
Electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy by using an electric motor. Electric motor works on the basis of rule suggested by Marie Ampere and Fleming’s Left Hand Rule.

In an electric motor, a rectangular coil is suspended between the two poles of a magnetic field. The electric supply to the coil is connected with a commutator. Commutator is a device which reverses the direction of flow of electric current through a circuit.

When electric current is supplied to the coil of electric motor, it gets deflected because of magnetic field. As it reaches the half way, the split ring which acts as commutator reverses the direction of flow of electric current. Reversal of direction of current reverses the direction of forces acting on the coil. The change in direction of force pushes the coil; and it moves another half turn. Thus, the coil completes one rotation around the axle. Continuation of this process keeps the motor in rotation.

"Electromagnetic Induction
Michael Faraday, an English Physicist is supposed to have studied the generation of electric current using magnetic field and a conductor.

When a conductor is set to move inside a magnetic field or a magnetic field is set to be changing around a conductor, electric current is induced in the conductor. This is just opposite to the exertion of force by a current carrying conductor inside a magnetic field. In other words, when a conductor is brought in relative motion vis-à-vis a magnetic field, a potential difference is induced in it. This is known as electromagnetic induction.

Electromagnetic induction can be explained with the help of Fleming’s Right Hand Rule. If the right hand is stretched in a way that the index finger, middle finger and thumb are in mutually perpendicular directions, then the thumb shows the direction of movement of the conductor, index finger shows the direction of magnetic field and the middle finger shows the direction of induced current in the conductor. The directions of movement of conductor, magnetic field and induced current can be compared to three mutually perpendicular axes, i.e. x, y and z axes.

The mutually perpendicular directions also point to an important fact that the when the magnetic field and movement of conductor are perpendicular, the magnitude of induced current would be maximum.

Since oxygen is absent in the digester, the anaerobes carry on their work of decomposition. The process of decomposition produces biogas. Biogas has about 70% of methane and the rest is composed of other gases. The biogas is channelized through a pipe and can be utilized as kitchen fuel and also as fuel for getting light. The slurry; left behind; is removed. It is used as manure, once it dries.

"Ocean Thermal Energy: The water at sea surface is hot during daytime, while the water at lower level is cold. The temperature differential in water levels can be utilized to generate energy. If the temperature differential is more than 20°C, then ocean thermal energy can be utilized from that place. For this, a volatile liquid; like ammonia; is boiled using the heat from the hot water at the surface. The steam of the volatile liquid is utilized to run the turbine to generate electricity. Colder water from the surface below is utilized to condense ammonia vapour which is then channelized to the surface to repeat the cycle.

Nuclear power is safest for the environment but the risk of damage due to accidental leaks of radiation is pretty high. Further, storage of nuclear waste is a big problem because of potential risk of radiation involved. Nonetheless, many countries are using nuclear power in a big way. India too has built many nuclear power plants. Recent accidents in the nuclear power plants in Chernobyl and Japan have forced the policymakers to rethink about the nuclear power.
