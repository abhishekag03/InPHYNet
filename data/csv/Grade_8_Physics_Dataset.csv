"Force: A push or pull on an object is called force.

At least two objects need to interact for force to come into play. Mutual interaction between two objects results in a force between the two objects.
When two forces are applied on an object in the same direction, there is an add-on effect of both forces.
When two forces are applied in opposite directions, the difference between two forces gives the value of the net force.
Force is expressed in terms of its magnitude and the direction in which it is working. Any change in direction or magnitude of the force, there is a change in effect of the force.
Generally, more than one force is acting on an object at any given time.","Definition, Effects, Causes, Property"
"A force can change the state of motion. Both rest and motion are called states of motion. When an object is at rest, its speed is zero.","Definition, Effects"
Effect of force on an object at rest: A force can move an object at rest. For example; if a force is applied on a book the book can move in the direction of force.,"Effects, Examples"
"Effect of force on a moving object: A force can have following effects on a moving object.

When the applied force is in the same direction as direction of motion, there is an increase in the speed of object.
When the applied force is in opposite direction of motion, there is a decrease in the speed of object. The object may also come to rest when the applied force is in opposite direction to the direction of motion.
When the applied force is at some acute or obtuse angle to the direction of motion, there is a change in the direction of motion.","Effects, Examples"
"Effect of Force on Shape: Force can change the shape of an object. When force is applied on a ball of dough, there is a change in the shape of dough. Similarly, a potter changes a lump of clay into pots by applying force. When air is filled in a balloon; the shape of the balloon changes because of the applied force.","Effects, Examples"
"There are two main types of forces, viz. contact force and non-contact force.",Types
"Contact Force: Contact force is a force which can produce its effect only by making a contact with object. Following are the contact forces:
",Definition
Muscular Force: It is the force applied by muscles of humans or animals. A bullock is able to pull a cart because of muscular force. The bullock needs to be harnessed to the cart for applying the force.,"Definition, Examples"
"Friction: When one surface is moving over another surface, a force comes into play and opposes their relative motion. This force is called friction or force of friction. Friction always opposes motion because it acts in opposite direction to motion. Force of friction arises due to contact between two surfaces. If there is no contact between two surfaces there would be no friction.","Definition, Property, Causes"
Non-contact Force: The non-contact force is a force which can produce its effect without making a contact with object. Following are the non-contact forces:,"Definition,"
Magnetic Force: The force applied by a magnet is called magnetic force. A magnet can exert its force on an object even from a distance and does not need to touch that object.,"Definition, Property"
"Electrostatic Force: It is the force applied by a charged body on another charged or non-charged body. When you brush a comb in your hairs and then bring the comb near small bits of paper, the comb attracts the bits of paper. This happens because of electrostatic force.","Definition, Examples"
Gravitational Force: Every object in the universe exerts a force on another object. This force is called gravitational force. It is the gravitational force of various celestial bodies which keeps them in their position in the space.,"Definition, Examples, Property"
"Pressure is the force acting on a unit area on an object.

Pressure = Force/Area on which it acts

In this equation, force is the numerator and area is the denominator. This means that pressure is directly proportional to the applied force but inversely proportional to the area on which it is acting.","Definition, Formula, Relation"
"Following examples illustrate this effect:

It is easier to push a nail into a wooden door through its pointed end than through its blunt end, because small area of the pointed end helps in creating more pressure and it becomes easier to insert the nail.
Shoulder straps of your school bag are wide. A larger area helps in reducing the pressure on the shoulder; and makes it less painful to carry the bag.
Camel’s feet are wide; making for larger area. Due to this, a camel can easily walk on sand.
Eskimos wear ski-like footwear. Wider area of the footwear reduces pressure and thus prevents the Eskimo’s feet from sinking in ice.",Examples
"Liquids and gases exert pressure as follows:

Pressure on the bottom of container depends on the height of column of gas or liquid. Due to this, divers have to withstand a large pressure at the bottom of the sea.
A fluid exerts pressure on walls of the container. Containers for gases and liquids are usually cylindrical ion shape to equally distribute the pressure on all portions of the wall.
A fluid exerts equal pressure at same depth.","Examples, Property, Causes"
Atmospheric Pressure: The pressure exerted by atmospheric air is called atmospheric pressure. The weight of air in a column of height of atmosphere and area 10 x 10 cm is 1000 kg. This is roughly same as the area of our head. Can you believe that you have 1000 kg of air on your head?,"Definition, Examples"
Paragraph,AnsTypes
"Force is a push or a pull. Living and non- living things can apply force. To apply a force over an object interaction between object and source of force is necessary. Whenever force act two object are involved. One which applied force, the other which receive force. Examples: To kick ball we need to push it, to pick the book we need to pull it, to hit the ball we need to push it and to lift the box we need to push it.","Definition, Causes, Examples"
The measurement of strength and amount of force is called magnitude of force. Two or more forces on the same object can be applied in the same direction and opposite direction.,"Definition, Property"
"When two or more forces are applied in the same direction, then the total or net force is the addition of magnitude of both the forces. Example: When two persons push the box in the same direction with the magnitude of forces of each 2 N, then resultant force will be-Net force:- 2N + 2N= 4N (In the direction of applied force)","Reasoning, Examples"
"When two forces are applied over an object in the opposite directions, the total effective or net force is the difference of magnitude of two forces. Example:(i) When two persons push the box in the opposite direction with the magnitude of forces of each 2 N, then resultant force will be-Net force:- 2N - 2N= 0N (Box will not move) (ii) If one person is applying a force of 6 unit in one direction and another person is applying a force of 8 unit in opposite direction, Then the resultant force: 8N - 6N= 2N (In the direction of higher magnitude force). In this case, force will act in the direction of higher magnitude of force.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Force can change the state of motion: An Object can be in two states. (a) Rest State: When an object is not moving. This means a stationary object is called in the state of rest. For example –A ball and book kept over the ground and not moving. (b) Motion State: A moving object is called in the state of motion. For example – a moving car, a moving ball, etc. A Force can move a stationary object. A force can speed up, decrease the speed and change the direction of a moving object. Force can stop a moving object. Finally we can say that force can change the state of motion","Effects, Definition, Examples "
"Some examples: A boy want to move a tyre faster it has to be pushed repeatedly, Change in the direction of moving ball after it strikes the ruler placed in its path, In the Football game, a goalkeeper stops the football going towards the goal post by applying a force by his hand. In the cricket game, a batsman can push a fast moving ball in the same direction or opposite direction or change the direction of the movement of ball. Because of force being applied from his bat.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Force can change the shape of an object:(i) When you apply force on an inflated balloon by pressing it using your hand from both sides, then the force of pressure changes the shape of balloon.(ii) You can change the shape of rubber band and spring by stretching it in opposite direction.(iii)You can change the shape of dough into bread by applying force with a rolling pin. So we can say that forces can change the shape of an object.
","Effects, Examples, Reasoning"
"Types of Force:1. Contact Force: (a) For contact force, interaction between objects is necessary. Force that comes into action after the interaction between objects is called contact force. Contact force works on the point of contact. Example; pushing a car, hitting the ball, kicking a ball, etc. (b) Muscular force, friction force are types of contact force.","Types, Definition, Examples"
"Muscular force: Force due to the action of muscles is called muscular force. We can say force resulting because of action of muscle is called muscular force. Muscular force is applied only after interaction with the object. Examples: (a) When we push the object like school bag or lift the bucket of water we use the muscular force, (b) Animals also use of muscular force to carry out their task.","Definition, Examples"
"Friction Force: The forces of friction arises between the surfaces of two objects. The force of friction always acts on all moving object and its direction is always opposite to the direction of motion. Force of friction comes into action only after interaction between two objects, thus, it is a type of contact force.","Definition, Types"
"Examples: Due to force of friction between the surface of the ball and the ground that brings the moving ball to rest, When we stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually slow down and finally comes to s stop due to force of friction.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Non- Contacting Force: Force due to without interaction between two objects is called non-contact force. For example; a magnet can pull an iron nail from a distance, Magnetic force, Electrostatic force and Gravitational force are examples of non-contact force.","Definition, Types, Examples"
Magnetic Force: A magnet can exert a force on another magnet without being in contact with it. The force exerted by a magnet is an example of a non-contact force. Example: Opposite pole of two magnets attract each other and same pole repel each other.,"Definition, Examples, Types"
"Electrostatic Force: When a charged body exert a force on another charged or uncharged body is called electrostatic force. A charged body attracts an uncharged body. A positively charged body attracts a negatively charged body and repels a positively charged body without coming in contact, thus it is a non-contact force.","Definitiion, Types"
"Gravitational Force: Gravitation force is exerted by earth, moon, sun and other planets to others. Earth and other planets attract all objects towards them. Since, earth attracts all objects even without coming in contact, thus gravitational force is a non-contact force.Example: When we release an object from a height, it falls over the ground because of gravitational attraction of earth.","Definition, Examples, Types"
"Pressure: The force acting on per unit area of a surface is called pressure. We can say force per unit area is called pressure. Pressure = Force / Area. From above formula, we can say that with same applied force, Pressure is indirectly proportional to the area, thus pressure decreases with increase in area and increases with decrease in area.","Definition, Formula, Relation"
"Example: (i) When we cut an apple, we need to use the sharp edge of the knife instead of blunt knife because the sharp edge of knife has small surface area and we need to exert less force with high pressure to cut the apple. (ii) When we put a nail into a wooden board, the pointed end of the nail is kept at the front. The pointed end of the nail has very small surface area and this enables us to apply a greater pressure with the applied force.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Pressure exerted by Liquid and Gas: (i) Liquid and gas can also exert pressure on inner walls of the container in which they are kept. (ii) When air is filled, a rubber balloon gets inflated from all sides. This happens due to air or gas exerts pressure over inner walls of the balloon. (iii) Water starts leaking if there is a pore in the bottle. This happens due to water exerts pressure over the walls of the bottle.","Types, Examples, Reasoning "
"Atmospheric Pressure: (i) Our atmosphere is made of different types of gases. Since gases exert pressure, thus Pressure exerted by air (present in atmosphere) is called atmospheric pressure. (ii) The weight of air in a column of the height of the atmosphere and area 10 cm × 10 cm is as large as 1000 kg. The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure and cancels the pressure from outside. (iii) A pressed rubber sucker on a plane surface does not come off because of atmospheric pressure.","Definition, Reasoning, Examples"

Paragraph ,Ans Types
"In our daily life, we apply force on many objects, due to which the objects change their position or shape. Eg : When a football is kicked, it moves. When we throw a smash a fully inflated balloon in between our palms, it breaks. When a cricket fielder catches the ball, it stops. A man cycling. In this chapter, we will study about force and its characteristics.",Example
"A push or a pull on an object is called a Force. Push refers to the force which tends to 'move the object away'  from the direction of the force applied. Pull refers to that force which tends to 'move the object towards'  the direction of the force applied. 
Examples of Push :
(i) Pushing a door open                 (ii) Man pushing his luggage trolley     (iii) Man hitting a golf ball
Examples of Pull:
(i)Opening the drawers                    (ii) Child pulling a wagon                            (iii) Crane pulling up an object ","Definition, Example"
"As we can see in all of the above cases, 2 or more objects must interact for force to come into play. Eg 1: In the case of man pulling his luggage trolley, there is an interaction between the man and his trolley. The man is applying a 'push' on his trolley to make it move forward. Eg 2: In the case of the crane pulling the object, there is an interaction between the crane and the object. The crane is applying force of the object to pull it up.",Example
"From the above figures, we can understand the following characteristics of Force

Force has both magnitude and direction.
Case (i) Magnitude of forces : F1,F2, Direction of forces: Left to Right (--->)
Case(ii) Magnitude of forces applied: F1,F2.
Direction of force F1 is Left to Right (--->). 
Direction of Force F2 is Right to Left (<---)
More than one force can be applied on an object.
Forces applied in the same direction add up to each other.
If forces are applied in the same direction, the total force adds up in the same direction. In case(i), forces are applied in the same direction. So the total force applied on the 'Heavy Object' is F1+F2 towards Right (--->)
If forces are applied in the opposite direction, then the net force acting on the object is the difference between the forces and the object tends to move in the direction of the greater force.
In case(ii),If F1=F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2=0. The object does not move in any direction.
If F1>F2, the net force on the object is F = F1-F2. The object moves in the direction of F1 ie towards Right (--->)
If F2>F1, the net force on the object is F = F2-F1. The object moves in the direction of F2 ie towards Left(<---)
If the magnitude or direction of the force changes, its effect also changes.","Property, Effects"
"A change in either speed of an object or direction of an object or both is described as a change in its state of motion. Force can change the state of motion of an object.

Let's consider the following sequence of events

A cricket ball is initially at rest.
The bowler picks it up and bowls it towards the batsman.
The batsman hits it with the bat. Subsequently, any of the following events could happen
The batsman hit the ball very hard such that it goes for flying in the air for a six.
The batsman hits the ball such that it goes for a four along the ground.
The batsman hits the ball and the bowler catches it.
The batsman hits a defense shot such that it rolls on the ground for a short distance and stops.
Now from (1) to (2), the ball has changed its speed. Initially, the speed for 0 m/s (at rest) and then the bowler flings it. So, now it moves with a certain speed. When the batsman hits the ball, according to the force applied on the ball, the direction or speed or both change. Any one of the events (a),(b),(c),(d) occurs. When the strike is very hard and upwards, it goes for a six(3a). When the strike is reasonably hard and along the ground, it goes for a four (3b). When the bowler catches it (3c), the bowler has applied has applied a force on it to stop it. When the force of the batsman is very weak, the ball rolls on the ground and eventually stops.","Example, Property"
"Force can change the shape of an object in some cases.

When making rotis from kneaded dough.
When force is applied on the lead of a pencil, it breaks.

"From the discussion above, we can summarize  that Force can have any or all of the following effects on the object on which it is applied.

Force can change the speed of an object (Batsman hitting a ball very hard)
Force can change the direction of motion of an object (Batsman hitting a ball very hard)
Force can change the shape of an object. (When an elastic is pulled hard, it breaks)

"Frictional Force is a force that acts on all moving objects by the surface which it is in contact with. Eg: A ball rolling on the ground encounters friction by the ground surface and it eventually comes to a halt. When the rowing of the boat has stopped, the boat comes to a stop because of the frictional force exerted by water on it. The Frictional force is always in the direction opposite to the applied force.","Definition, Example, Property"

Electrostatic force is the force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body. Eg: Take a comb and brush it on a hair 3-4 times and then take it near some small bits of paper. Donot touch the comb with the paper. The bits of paper would get attracted to the comb.

"Force acting on unit area is called Pressure ie Pressure =   Force/Area

This explains why it is easier to hammer a nail into the wall. It is because we apply a greater amount of force into a very small area of the screw head. Going by the above equation, the force is large and the area is small. So, the pressure is very high.  There are instances when you also can feel pressure - when you are having a body massage. When a person massages your body with his hands, the force applied is very high on a relatively small area of his hand. The pressure is high and there is bearable but curative pain and pressure that you feel.","Definition, Formula, Causes"

A pull or push over an object is called force.,Definition
"Example – to open a drawer, one has to pull it; and to close the drawer one has to push it. Thus, in both the conditions a person applies force by pull or push.",Examples
"To kick a ball, one has to push it, i.e. a force is applied.",Causes
"To ride a bicycle one has to push the pedal. In this condition, force is applied while pushing the pedal.",Causes
Forces are due an interaction:,Causes
To apply a force over an object interaction between object and source of force is necessary.,Property
"Direction and Magnitude of Force:
The measure of amount or strength of force is called the magnitude of force. Thus, strength or amount of force is expressed in terms of magnitude.",Definition
"Condition when more than two forces are applied over an object:
Forces applied in same direction:
When more than one force is applied in the same direction, the total force is the magnitude of both the forces.
Example – It is difficult to push a car by single person, but two or more persons can collectively push the same car easily. This is because when more than one person tries to push the car, magnitudes of forces applied by each of the person are summed up and applied over than car, and car is pushed easily because of greater magnitude of force.
That means if three units of force are applied over an object by each of the two persons,
The total unit of force = sum of both forces = 3 unit + 3 unit = 6 unit
Forces applied in opposite direction:
When two forces are applied over an object from opposite directions, the total effective force is the difference of two forces.
(a) When two persons are pushing a box in opposite directions and the magnitude of both the forces is equal, then box will not move, because the difference of two forces will be equal to zero.
Let a person applying 4 unit of force in one direction and other person is also applying 4 unit of force in opposite direction on the same wooden box.
Therefore, the magnitude of total force = 4 unit – 4 unit = 0
(b) If one person is applying a force of 4 unit in one direction and another person is applying a force of 6 unit in opposite direction,
Then total magnitude of force = 6 unit – 4 unit = 2 unit
Thus, force will act in the direction of larger magnitude of force.

"Force can change the state of motion:
State of rest:
An object is called in the state of rest when it is not moving. This means a stationary object is called in the state of rest. For example – a building, an electric pole, a ball kept over the ground and not moving, etc.
State of motion:
A moving object is called in the state of motion. For example – a moving car, a moving ball, etc.
A force can speed up a moving object. Force can decrease the speed of a moving object. Force can stop a moving object. Force can change the direction of a moving object. Force can move a stationary object.
Example –
In the game of cricket, when a batsman pushes a fast moving ball in the same direction of the movement of ball, the speed of the ball is increased.
When a batsman pushes a fast moving ball in the opposite direction the speed of ball decreases; because of force being applied from his bat.

"Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. Friction can work for or against us. For example, putting sand on an icy sidewalk increases friction so you are less likely to slip. On the other hand, too much friction between moving parts in a car engine can cause the parts to wear out. Other examples of friction are illustrated in the two","Definition, Examples, Reasoning"
"Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, Why does this make your hands warmer? The answer is friction.","Reasoning, Causes"
"Why Friction Occurs
Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces that look smooth to the unaided eye make look rough or bumpy when viewed under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in the Figure below. The aluminum foil is so smooth that it's shiny. However, when highly magnified, the surface of metal appears to be very bumpy. All those mountains and valleys catch and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts the metal. This creates friction.
","Causes, Reasoning"
"Factors that Affect Friction
Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. That's why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads. Increasing the area of surfaces that are touching also increases the friction between them. That's why you can't slide as far across ice with shoes as you can on the thin blades of skates. The greater surface area of the soles of the shoes cause more friction and slow you down.","Causes, Reasoning"
"Heavier objects also have more friction. Can you explain why?Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this causes greater friction between them.","Causes, Reasoning"
"Friction Produces Heat
You know that friction produces heat. That's why rubbing your hands together makes them warmer. But do you know why? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy. This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match as shown in the Figure below. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem. It can cause the car to overheat.","Effects, Property, Reasoning"
"How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car engine?
To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide over each other more easily, so there is less friction.","Causes, Reasoning, Effects"
"Friction is always parallel to the surface in contact.
In some cases, friction is desirable while in other cases, friction reduces the effectiveness of machines. Without friction, you would not be able to walk, the wheels on a vehicle would have no grip on a road surfacing and the vehicle would not be able to move forward.On the other hand, friction is undesirable in most of the cases. Friction causes mechanical parts to seize and wear out.","Causes, Reasoning, Effects"
"Types of Friction
Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are in contact. There are four types of friction: static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction (Air/Viscous friction). Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur between solid surfaces. Fluid friction occurs in liquids and gases.","Types, Property"
"Static Friction
Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For example, if you are hiking in the woods, there is static friction between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see Figure below). Without this static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it difficult to walk. In fact, that's exactly what happens if you try to walk on ice. That's because ice is very slippery and offers very little friction.","Reasoning, Causes, Property"
"Can you think of other examples of static friction?
One example is the friction that helps the girls climb the rock wall in the picture above. Static friction keeps their hands and feet from slipping.","Example, Reasoning"
"Sliding Friction
Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than static friction. That's why it's easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place. Sliding friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you write with a pencil. The pencil ""lead"" slides easily over the paper, but there's just enough friction between the pencil and paper to leave a mark.","Defintion, Property, Example, Reasoning"
"How does sliding friction help you ride a bike?
There is sliding friction between the brake pads and bike rims each time you use your bike's brakes. This friction slows the rolling wheels so you can stop.","Reasoning, Example"
"Rolling Friction
Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or static friction. This explains why most forms of ground transportation use wheels, including bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates, scooters, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling friction. You can see what they look like in the Figure below. They let parts of a wheel or other machine roll rather than slide over on another.","Definition, Property, Examples, Reasoning"
The ball bearings in this wheel reduce friction between the inner and outer cylinders when they turn.,Property
It is found that:Rolling friction < sliding friction < static friction.,"Relation, Property"
"Fluid Friction
Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through a fluid. A fluid is a substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you've ever tried to push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you've experienced fluid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water against your hand. Look at the skydiver in the Figure below. He's falling toward Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the air against the parachute slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater is the fluid friction resisting its motion. That's why there is greater air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver's body.","Definition, Property, Examples, Reasoning, Causes"
"Advantages of Friction
•   Friction between pen and paper enables us to write on the paper
.•   Friction between our feet and the ground allows our movements like standing, walking and running.
•   Friction between the surface of the road and tyres of our vehicles allow the vehicles to move without slipping.","Examples, Reasoning, Property"
"Disadvantages of Friction
•   Friction causes moving objects to stop or slow down
•   Friction produces heat causing wastage of energy in machines
•   Friction causes wear and tear of moving parts of machinery, soles of shoes, etc.","Property, Reasoning"
"Methods of Increasing and Reducing Friction
In real life, there are circumstances where we have to increase the friction and minimize the friction. Friction can be increased by increasing the roughness of the surfaces in contact. For example, treading of shoes and tires is done to increase friction. When friction is undesirable we have to reduce the friction. Friction can be minimized by using lubricants like oil and grease and by using ball bearing between machine parts. A substance that is introduced between two surfaces in contact, to reduce friction, is called a lubricant. Fluid friction can be minimized by giving suitable shapes to the objects moving in the fluids.","Effects, Property, Reasoning, Definition"
"Friction Is A Necessary Evil 
There are instances in daily life where friction is a necessity. For example, without friction, we cannot hold objects in our hands; we cannot walk and cannot light a match stick. Sometimes friction is not desirable, for example friction between machinery parts, which causes wear and tear. As friction is advantageous to us it is considered as a friend but due to its disadvantages it is a foe. Depending on the circumstance, friction can be a help or a hindrance. Thus it is a necessary evil.","Reasoning, Property"
Paragraph ,Ans Types
"Friction: When one surface is moving over another surface, a force comes into play and opposes their relative motion. This force is called friction or force of friction. Friction always opposes motion because it acts in opposite direction to motion. Force of friction arises due to contact between two surfaces. If there is no contact between two surfaces there would be no friction.","Definition, Property"
"Factors Affecting Friction:
Irregularities on surfaces: Friction is created because of irregularities on surfaces. The irregularities on surfaces result in interlocking of two surfaces. The interlocking between two surfaces creates friction. Hence, the force of friction will be greater in case of rough surface than in case of smooth surface.

Pressure Between two Surfaces: The force of friction increases with increase in pressure between two surfaces. You must have seen that moving a heavy box is difficult compared to moving a light box. Pressure is higher in case of a heavy box.",Causes
"Types of Friction:
Static Friction: The minimum amount of force that is required to overcome the force of friction is called static friction. In other words, the minimum force that is required to make an object moving is called static friction.
Sliding Friction: Once an object starts moving on a surface, some force is required to keep the object moving. The minimum force that is required to keep a moving object in motion at a constant speed is called sliding friction. Sliding friction is always less than static friction. Due to this, it is easier to push a moving box compared to pushing a static box.
Rolling Friction: When an object rolls over a surface, the friction created is called rolling friction. Rolling friction is less than sliding friction.
","Types, Definition, Property"
"Friction: A Necessary Evil
Friction is all pervasive. Even a simple task; like writing on a page; cannot be done without friction. Walking on road won’t be possible because friction. But friction causes wear and tear of materials, and wastage of energy. Thus, friction is beneficial as well as harmful. Hence, friction is called a necessary evil.

",Reasoning
"Benefits of Friction
It is not possible to even walk on the road; in the absence of friction. Walking on ice is almost impossible because of lack of friction.
Friction is necessary to keep a ladder against a wall. The ladder will not find grip against the wall in the absence of friction.
It is very difficult to drive on a wet road because of less friction. A thin film of water is made over the surface of road. This thin film of water greatly reduces friction. Due to this, the driver finds it difficult to control the vehicle while driving on a wet road.","Reasoning, Property, Effects"
"Harms of Friction
It results in wear and tear of shoes and tyres, machine parts, clothes, etc. It causes monetary loss.
Heat is generated by friction, which results in wastage of energy. Moreover, a significant amount of energy is wasted in overcoming friction.","Reasoning, Causes"
"Ways to Increase Friction
Rubber grips are put on bicycle handles, electrical tools and on many other tools. Increased friction helps in giving better grip on these objects.
A surface can be made rough with the help of sand paper; in order to increase friction.
Soles of shoes are made rough to increase friction. This helps in providing better grip on surface while walking.
Treads of tyres are deliberately made so that a good road grip can be achieved with the help of friction.
Holding a bottle cap with a thick towel helps in increasing friction. Increased friction makes it easier to open the bottle cap.","Reasoning, Property"
"Ways to Reduce Friction
Lubricating oil and grease are used in machines to reduce friction between moving parts.
Some machines use air cushion for reducing friction because use of oil is not ideal in such machines.
Graphite powder is used in some machines to reduce friction.
Ball bearing coverts sliding friction into rolling friction. You have read that rolling friction is less than sliding friction. Thus, ball bearing helps in reducing friction.","Reasoning, Property"
"Fluid Friction
When an object moves through a fluid, the fluids create friction. Friction created by a fluid is called fluid friction or drag. Force of friction is directly proportional to the density of a fluid. Hence, friction in oil will be greater than in water. Similarly, friction in water will be greater than that in air.","Definition, Relation, Property"
"Streamlined Shape: A shape which is wide in middle and tapered at ends is called a streamlined shape. Such a shape reduces drag or fluid friction. Hence, a streamlined body can easily move through a fluid. Birds and fish are naturally endowed with streamlined body. Boats and airplanes are also made streamlined so that they can easily move through air or water.","Definition, Relation, Property"

"Force of Friction:
(i) Friction is the force which resists the relative motion of surfaces.
(ii) All types of surface like solid, liquid and air offer the force of friction.
(iii) Friction force always applies in the opposite direction of movement.
(iv) Friction is applied when two surfaces in contact move relative to each other.","Definition, Property"
"Examples:
(a) A moving wheel on the ground stops after covering a certain distance because surface of ground offers opposite direction friction to the surface of wheel in motion.
(b) After applying breaks to a moving bike, the surface of brakes offers friction to the surface of moving wheel and the bicycle stops because of force of friction.
(c) Gently push a book on a table. It stops after moving for some distance because of friction between the surfaces of book and table.","Examples, Causes, Reasoning"
"Factors affecting Friction:
(i) Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact.
(ii) Even those surfaces which appear very smooth but microscopic view show those irregularities. When these surfaces come into contact, the irregularities of surfaces get interlocked. We have to apply force to remove the interlocking, a surface produces friction when it slides or rolls over another surface. 
(iii) Friction force will increase with increase in weight. As weight increases irregularities between surfaces get interlocked tightly because of pressure, and the surface offers more resistance of friction.
Example: It is easier to dragging a mat when nobody is sitting on it than a person is sitting on it because of friction increases with increase in weight.
(iv) Rougher surface offers more force of friction.
","Property, Relation"
"Sliding Friction:
(i) This friction comes in to action when a surface slides over another surface and resist its motion is called sliding friction.
(ii) Example: sliding of book or a box over ground.","Definition, Examples"
" Rolling Friction:
(i) This friction comes into action when a surface rolls over another surface and resist its motion is called rolling friction.
(ii) Rolling friction is smaller than sliding friction. Due to this roll anything over the ground is easier than to slide.","Definition, Property"
"Friction: A Necessary Evil:
Friction is a necessary evil because it has both harmful and beneficial effects.
Examples:
(i) We can walk easily because ground offers friction. In the less friction walking situation becomes almost impossible. Therefore, friction is necessary even a simple task like walking.
(ii) It is difficult task to move on a wet muddy track, or wet marble floor. This is because these surfaces offer very small friction to the surface of feet of a person.
(iii) Soles of shoes have grooves on them. Grooved soles give more friction to the ground which gives better grip when we walk. Shoes with worn out soles can be slippery.
(iv) The tyres of vehicles have treads for better grip over road. It provides friction to the surface of road. When treads are worn out, the tyres need to be replaced with new one.
(v) Friction can also produce heat. Vigorously rub your palms together for a few minutes.
(vi) Writing with pen is possible because paper provides friction to the tip of pen.
(vii)When a machine is operated, heat generated causes much wastage of energy.","Effects, Property, Examples"
"Increase of friction:
(i) Friction is desirable in some situations
(ii) Friction is necessary for us, therefore friction is increased to accomplish Some of important task.
Examples:
(a) Treaded tyres of vehicle increase friction. Vehicle with treaded tyres provides mores friction which gives better grip with the road.
(b)  Soles of shoes are treaded to increase friction between sole and the ground.
(c)  Javelin thrower rubs some powder on his palm to get better grip on the javelin.
(d)  Kabaddi players rub their hands with soil for a better grip of their opponents.

","Property, Examples, Reasoning"
"Reduction of friction:
(i) In Some situations, friction is undesirable. We need to reduce it.
(ii) With help of lubricant we can reduce the friction. Lubricants make a thin layer over surface and facilitate smooth movement.
(iii) In the engines of vehicles, use of lubricants increases the efficiency as parts are not rubbed directly each other because of thin layer of lubricant.
(iv) In many machines, graphite powder, oil, grease are used as lubricant for reducing friction.
(v) Few drops of oil are poured on the hinges of a door for reducing friction, the door moves smoothly.
(vi) While playing carom, sprinkle fine powder over it to reduce friction.

"Fluid Friction:
(i) Gases and liquids are generally known as fluid. Similar to solid, fluids also provide friction. The friction of fluid increases with the speed of object moving through it and speed of fluid.
(ii) Objects which are made to move in fluid are made streamlined shape to reduce friction offered by fluid. The shape of aeroplane, ship, boat, birds and fish are made streamlined shape. A shape which is pointed on both ends and wide at the middle is called streamlined shape which facilitates easier movement through fluids.

"Friction is a type of forces that opposes motion. It is that forces which always acts in a direction opposite to that of the applied force. In case of a ball freely rolling on the ground, the ball eventually comes to stop, because of the force of friction that acts between the ball and the ground.

"As we studied in the previous case, friction is caused by the interaction between the surfaces which are in contact. Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces which are in contact. The irregularities on both surfaces tend to lock into each other and this resists the motion of the object. The nature of the surface (smoothness or roughness) affects the friction.","Causes, Property"
"Smooth surfaces have lesser irregularities. The lesser the irregularities, the lesser the tendency to lock. The lesser the tendency to lock with another object, the lesser the friction (that is tendency to oppose motion). And so, a ball rolls faster and covers a greater a distance on a smooth surface such as a marble floor or a wet floor. Think of the bowling game.","Property, Examples"
"Rough surfaces have more irregularities. The more the irregularities, the more tendency to lock. The more the tendency to lock, the more the friction (that is tendency to oppose motion). And so, a ball rolls slowly and covers a lesser distance on a rough surface such as muddy play ground. Think of a rough muddy playground. So, it obviously means that to get the ball rolling we have to apply a force which is greater than the frictional force offered by the ground.","Property, Examples"

Sound is a form of energy that travels in the form of vibrations through the air or any another medium.
Vibration is defined as a rapid to and fro or up and down movement about a mean position.
Vibrations travel through a medium such as air and reach our ears where they are interpreted by the brain as sound.
Human beings are capable of producing sound which originates from the larynx or the voice box in the neck. The sound produced is controlled by thin membranous structures known as vocal cords that stretch across the larynx.
The vibrating body can be- a stretched animal hide (as in drums and table), stretched strings (as in guitar and sitar), or air columns (as in flute or pipes).","Defintion, Causes, Property"

You can produce slower vibration in a simple pendulum. It consists simply of a weight hanging by a thread. When the ball is given a small push, it performs to and fro movements which you can easily observe. These slow vibrations are also known as oscillations.","Reasoning, Property"
"Characteristics of vibration
The important characteristics of vibrations are its frequency, amplitude and time period. These determine the characteristics of the sound produced.",Property
"Frequency:
The number of vibrations made by the vibrating body in one second is known as its frequency.
The SI unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz).",Definition
"Amplitude:
The maximum extent of vibration of the vibrating body from its mean position is known as its amplitude.",Definition
"Time period:
The time taken by the vibrating body for one complete vibration is known as the time period of vibration. It is denoted by T.

Time period and frequency are reciprocals of each other.","Definition, Formula, Relation"
"Characteristics of sound
Sound can be characterized by the loudness, pitch and quality.",Property
"Loudness:
Based on the amplitude of a sound wave, we can determine the loudness of the sound. When the amplitude is high, it will produce a sound that is loud and when the amplitude is low, it will produce a sound that is soft.
Loudness is proportional to the square of the amplitude. This means that if the amplitude is doubled, the loudness increases four times.","Property, Relation"
"Pitch:
Pitch denotes the shrillness or flatness of a sound. Sound can be high or low.
A woman’s voice generally has a high pitch than a man’s voice. This is because the frequency of a woman’s voice is higher.","Definition, Property"
"Quality (Timbre):
The quality of a sound is that property by virtue of which two sounds of the same pitch and loudness produced by the two different musical instrument or people can be distinguished.",Definition
"How sound travel?
Sound travels through a medium in the form of waves. When vibrations take place, they are transmitted through a medium and form alternate compression and rarefactions.
Compressions are regions in the medium where the particles are closer whereas rarefactions are regions in the medium where the particles are spread out.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"Speed of sound:
The speed of sound changes with the change in medium. Speed also depends on the physical state and temperature of the medium. At higher temperature, the speed of sound is higher, while at lower temperature, the speed decreases.

Audible sounds are those that can be heard while inaudible sounds are those that cannot be heard.
Human can hear sounds with frequency between 20Hz and 20,000Hz.

Paragraph ,Ans Types
"Introduction
Sound is a form of energy and it comes from vibrations. These vibrations create sound waves which move through mediums such as air and water before reaching our ears. Understand how sound waves come from vibrations in the form of compression and rarefaction and how your ears give you the ability to hear them.","Definition, Property"
"The difference between Musical sound and noise - Music is produced by periodic vibrations, having regular wave pattern e.g. sound of musical instruments. Noise is produced by irregular vibrations, having irregular wave pattern. e.g.. sound produced by moving vehicle.","Definition, Example"
"Learn about the characteristics of sound
•   Loudness-It distinguishes between loud and feeble sound
•   Pitch-It distinguishes between shriller and flatter sound.
•   Timbre or quality-It distinguishes one sound from other having same loudness and pitch.","Definition, Property"
"Learn about free(natural ) vibrations - When we strike the keys of a piano, various strings set in vibrations at their natural frequencies in absence of any external force on it. Damped vibrations - When a body is made to vibrate in a medium, the amplitude of vibrating body continuously decreases with time and ultimately body stops vibrating. Such vibrations are called the damped vibrations.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"When we want to tune a radio or TV set, we merely adjust the values of electronic components to produce vibrations of frequency equal to that of radio waves which we want to receive. Learn how this matching is done due to resonance. Resonance is the phenomenon when the frequency of an applied periodic force is equal to its the natural frequency, the body readily begins to vibrate with an increased amplitude. Understand the conditions of resonance and forced vibrations.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Sound needs a medium to propagateThe traveling of sound is called propagation of sound. Sound cannot propagate in the absence of a medium. The place where there is no air or air is removed, is called vacuum. Sound does not propagate (travels) through vacuum.Sound travels through solid, liquid and gas.We usually hear sound which comes to us through air.Aquatic animals communicate as sound travels through water also.We hear the sound through ear","Definition, Property"
"Vibrations Produce soundHow is sound produced? From loudspeakers to guitars, all sound-producing devices share one common feature: vibration. The amount of vibration, as well as the speed of the vibration, produce the different sounds our ears can recognize.In this blog post, weï¿½ll look at the science behind sound and study how instruments like the guitar and piano create sound. We'll also look at how modern hi-fi systems produce sound, as well as factors that can affect the clarity of sound.","Causes, Property, Reasoning"
"In simple terms, sound is vibration. The complex internal structure of our ears can respond to the waves produced by vibration, whether in the form of bass drum or an acoustic guitar.",Reasoning
"When an instrument produces vibrations, it creates oscillating sound waves. Some of these waves are audible to humans, while others are very deep or high-pitched, and fall outside the human range of hearing.",Property
"A variety of metrics are used to measure soundï¿½s intensity, volume and pitch. The pitch of sound is measures in hertz. One hertz (Hz) refers to the complete cycle of sound waves per second. Thus, 5,000Hz is equal to 5,000 cycles per second.",Property
"The human ear can generally perceive sound between 20Hz and 20,000Hz. Animals can often hear sound that humans canï¿½t. For example, dogs can hear sounds at very high frequencies ï¿½ often above 20,000Hz ï¿½ but cannot hear low frequency sounds.","Property, Examples"
"All sound is created through vibration. In fact, some people can perceive sounds by focusing solely on the vibration an instrument creates. Ludwig van Beethoven, who famously went deaf late in his life, continued to compose by using the vibration of his piano to ï¿½listenï¿½ to his compositions.","Causes, Property, Reasoning"
"Sound requires two components to be audible to the human ear: vibration, as well as amplification. Amplification can be provided by physical devices like the hollow body of a guitar, or by electrical hi-fi systems and speakers.",Property
"Letï¿½s start with the guitar. Acoustic guitars produce sound through the vibration of their strings. This sound is amplified by the guitarï¿½s hollow body, and the different strings each produce a different frequency ï¿½ and thus different pitch ï¿½ of sound.
The neck of a guitar contains anywhere from 12 to 24 frets. By pressing on each of these frets, the player changes the tension of the string, leading to a new frequency and a different pitch of note or chord.","Property, Reasoning"
"On a piano, sound is created in almost exactly the same way. Instead of plucking the strings, piano players push keys which trigger hammers that push the strings inside the piano. The body of the piano amplifies this sound just like the body of a guitar.","Property, Reasoning"
"While other instruments use different methods to create vibration and sound waves, the principles are the same: sound waves are created through vibration, and pitch is manipulated by changing the frequency of the vibration and sound waves","Property, Reasoning"
"If youï¿½ve ever taken the protective covers off a pair of hi-fi speakers, youï¿½ll know that they vibrate when you play music. Speakers produce sound using vibration, just like a piano or guitar. However, the design of speakers lets them create a far wider range of sounds than a piano or guitar could produce.","Property, Reasoning"
"Instead of using human energy to create vibration, like the plucking motion used to play a guitar or the tap of a piano keyï¿½s hammer, speakers convert electrical energy into vibration which, in turn, produces sound. Digital audio production software often includes a live view of sound waves as they are playing. The peaks in this view are the periods at which sound is loudest. This is when your speakers will be vibrating the most.","Property, Reasoning"
"Most speakers include several different speaker drivers, each of which can produce sounds of a certain frequency. The most common speaker drivers include tweeters, mid-range, woofers, and subwoofers",Property
"Have you ever heard an echo in a large room? Echoes occur when the sound waves produced by an instrument (including the human voice) or loudspeaker bounce off surfaces and travel back into your ears.Echoes can occur in live venues such as stadiums, or in enclosed spaces like lounges and living rooms.","Causes, Property"
One of the biggest challenges audio engineers and producers face is reducing echoes in studios and live performance venues.,Effects
"Since sound is created by vibration, the best way to reduce echoes is by installing a material that absorbs energy. This is why most studios have foam padding on their walls, or thick carpets designed to prevent sound reflecting and causing an echo.",Reasoning

External Ear: The external ear or pinna appears like a funnel. Its function is to catch sound waves and to direct them towards middle ear.,Property
"Middle Ear: The middle ear is composed of a stretched membrane and three small bones. The stretched membrane is called the ear drum and small bones are called bony ossicles. These are named sequentially from outside to inside as; malleus, incus, and stapes (hammer, anvil, and stirrup). When sound wave comes to the middle ear, it sets vibrations in the ear drum. After that, sound waves are transferred from ear drum transfers these vibrations to the three bones.",Property
"Internal Ear: The internal ear is composed of cochlea and semicircular canals. Cochlea appears like a snail from outside. Vibrations from middle ear reach the cochlea.

Factories should be relocated far from residential areas. Many factories from Delhi had been shifted to outskirts in the nineties.
Trees should be planted along the roads because trees absorb noise.
Sound barrier should be installed along flyovers.","Examples, Reasoning"
"Hearing Impairment: Loss of hearing is called hearing impairment. It can be total or partial, but total hearing impairment is rare. Total hearing impairment is usually congenital, i.e. by birth.

When electric current passes through the copper sulphate solution, the copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate.
The free copper gets attracted towards the negative terminal and is deposited on the plate connected to the negative terminal.
The copper present in the copper plate which is connected to the positive terminal gets dissolved in the copper sulphate solution, thus replacing the loss of copper from the solution.
And this process continues.
This process is called Electroplating",Reasoning
"Applications of Electroplating

Artificial jewelry, usually made of less expensive metals is often plated with a thin layer of a precious metal like gold and silver to make it more lustrous, appealing but cheaper.

Many industrial applications use electroplating to create a protective barrier on a metal substrate. The protective barrier in this case prevents tarnishing and gives a glossy appearance. Eg: Chromium plating is done on car spare parts, taps, wheel rims etc. Chromium is very expensive and the whole part cannot be made of chromium. So, it is coated with chromium to give it a shiny appearance.

Tinning (electroplating of tin) is a very cost-effective electroplating solution. Tin is relatively cheaper  and is used for electroplating electronic components, hardware products, fasteners, screws, nuts, bolts and food cans. If food is stored in iron cans, it would tend to get spoilt over a period of time. But, when iron is electroplated with tin, it prevents the food from getting spoilt. Tinning offers resistance against corrosion

Zinc electroplating offers excellent adhesion and resistance to corrosion. So, it is used to electroplate automobile parts and body, transmission components, defense carriers and tanks.

"We have heard a lightning many times, isn't it? Have you ever wondered how and why it occurs?  Is it dangerous? In this chapter we will discuss two naturally occurring phenomena - Lightning and Earthquake and its characteristics.","Examples, Causes, Effects"
"Lightning is caused due to static charges. So, before we understand lightning, let us understand about electric charges.",Reasoning
Electric changes at rest(without motion) is referred to as Static Electricity.,Definition
There are 2 types of static charges : Positive (+) and  Negative (-),Types
Static charges are produced by the friction between two interacting bodies (See examples below),Property
Static electric charges exert a force on each other. This force could be attractive or repulsive depending on the charge,Property
Two like charges repel each other. ,Property

"Experiment 1: Comb and Pieces of Paper
Experiment

Rub your hair with a comb.
Place it near small pieces of paper.
Observation

The pieces of paper are attracted towards the comb.
Analysis

Earlier, the comb and the pieces of paper were neutral
When we rubbed the comb on our hair, the electrons were transfered from hair to the comb. Now the comb is charged negatively.
When the comb is brought near the pieces of paper, the electric field of the comb influences the paper and it gets polarised ie the positive charges move near the comb and the negative charges on the other side of the comb. And hence they attract each other.
Conclusions

Static charges are produced by the friction between two interacting bodies
They exert a force on each other - Unlike charges attract each other

"Electroscope
It is an instrument used to detect electric charges.A simple electroscope can be constructed as follows.",Property
"Take a glass container.
Insert a metal wire inside it.
To the ends of the wire, which are inside the jar, attach 2 metal plates(say aluminium plates).
The other end is outside the glass container is connected or brought in contact with charged body.
",Examples
"The electroscope detects charge in the following way:

A charged object is brought in contact with the open end of the wire .
The charges are transferred via the wire which is a good conductor of electricity.
The aluminium plates also get charged and since they are similarly charged, they repel and move away from each other.
This confirms the presence of charge on the body.",Property
"Grounding & Discharging

If the charged body was brought close to the electroscope and then, we simultaneously touch the metal plates with your hand, then this would cause the charges to flow through your body ( your body is a good condutor of electricity) to the ground. This is called grounding. The plates no longer repel because their charges are 'discharged' to the ground because of grounding.","Reasoning, Property"
"Lightning
Now that we have studied about charges and its properties, let us look at lightning. We can see that lightning is also caused due to static electricity.",Causes
"During a rain, the air currents move upwards and water droplets (in the form of rain) move downwards.
In this process, the charges also gets separated ie the positive charges accumulate near the upper layers of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower layers.
On the ground, positive charges accumulate.
The magnitude of these charges grow larger and larger with time and intense rainfall.
Under such circumstances, air (which normally is a poor conductor of electricity), loses its resistance to electricity and begins to conduct.
When the air begins to conduct, the positive charges on the ground, meets the negative charges on the cloud and streaks of light is produced. This light an electric discharge and we see and call this as Lightning.
The process of electric discharge can occur between clouds and earth surface or even between 2 clouds because ultimately we are looking at an interaction between + and - charges.","Causes, Reasoning"
"Do's during lightning

Rush to a safe place. Generally, a lightning is preceded by thunder which serves as an alert to hide in closed buildings.
A house or a building or a car with closed windows and doors is a safe place to take shelter during a lightning.
If you don't find a place to hide, just squat on the ground or hide under shorter trees.",Effects
"Don'ts during lightning

During a lightning, no open place is safe because for obvious reasons as explained above. There could be current discharge right over your head or body. You could be the medium of conduction for the charges. So avoid open fields & open terraces.
Open vehicles like a motorbike, scooter and also open cars is
Never stand under tall trees and tall buildings.
Don't carry umbrellas
Don't lie down on the ground
Avoid bathing during thunderstorms to avoid contact running water which can conduct electric charges.
Avoid contact with metal wires, telephone cords, electrical wires since these can conduct the charges.","Effects, Reasoning"
"It is a device used in building during construction to protect the buildings from the effect of lightning.
A metallic rod is erected along the walls of the building during construction such that the tip is protruding outwards at the top of the building.
The top end is in air and is not in touch with any metallic surface.
The other end is buried in the ground.
When a lightning strikes, this provides a direct path for the charges to discharge to the ground, thereby not affecting anybody.",Property
An earthquake is a sudden shaking or tremors on the surface of earth lasting for a very short time but causing major devastation to human life and property,Definition
"Although, the surface of the earth tends to shake mildly frequently, earthquakes of large magnitude which cause devastation are quite rare.",Property
"Causes of an earthquake

The surface of the earth is not one smooth piece. It is fragmented into pieces called Plates which are always in motion. When one plates rubs or slides over another it causes an earthquake.",Causes
"Measurement of Earthquake

A device called Seismograph is used to record seismic waves produced during earthquakes on the surface of the earth. The purpose is to measure the motion or movement of ground during an earthquake",Definition
"Seismograph are generally connect to bedrocks which are considered comparatively more stable to earthquakes than buildings, other concrete structures, trees etc
In order to ensure that the seismograph itself is stable and does not shake we tie a heavy weight (like a pendulum shown here) to the seismograph body.
When the ground shakes, the pendulum shakes and the pen begins to write on the paper on the rolling drum. As the drum rotates, the pen continues to write like a waveform
Then the waveform which similar to what is shown in the figure is analysed to determine the magnitude of earthquake
",Reasoning
"The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of a magnitude on a scale called Richter scale.
",Definition
Destructive earthquakes generally have a magnitude of greater than 7 or 7.5. Earthquakes of magnitude 5-7 are moderate and below 5 are small or negligible.,Examples
"Protection against earthquakes

In seismic areas, houses have to built such that they are 'Quake Safe'. Special care has to be taken for this purpose.
During earthquakes, there are changes that fire might erupt and worsen the condition. So, building need to take precautionary fire fighting measures.
Mud/Timber is lighter and it is preferred over heavy construction material.
Roofs need to be as light as possible to minimise the damage in case of a fall.
While designing interiors, we should take care that cupboards are fixed to the wall so that they don't fall easily.
Similarly, hang photo frames, clocks and other design articles on the wall such that they don't fall on people
Don't stand under heavy and tall objects, buildings, power lines, trees etc. If you are driving, please move towards open spaces
If you are at home, take protection under a table.
If you are in bed, cover your head with a pillow. In seismic areas, beds should not be near heavy objects.
Beware of falling objects and protect your head with a bag/coat or pillow.

"Formation of Lightning
The water droplets move downward and the air current upward, during the development of a thunderstorm.
These movements result in the separation of charges. The negative charges are collected at the lower edges of the clouds while the positive charges near the upper edges.
When the magnitude of the gathered charges becomes large, the air no longer resists their flow. Positive and negative charges meet and give rise to streaks of bright light and sound. The resulting streaks are nothing but the lightning.","Causes, Effects"

"Earthquake
An earthquake is the sudden shaking of earth that lasts for a short duration. It is caused because of the disturbance deep inside the earth’s crust. Earthquakes occur all the time all over the world. Only major earthquakes are noticed and are less frequent","Definition, Causes"
"Let us look at how an earthquake occurs:

The outermost layer of the earth is fragmented and each fragment is known as a plate.
The plates are in continuous movement.
When a plate goes under another or brushes past against each other, a disturbance is caused in the earth’s crust.
This disturbance shows up as an earthquake on the surface of the earth.","Causes, Reasoning"
The boundaries of the plate are weak and are more to earthquakes. These weak zones are known as seismic or fault zones. Earthquakes can also be caused due to a volcanic eruption or when a meteor hits the earth. The magnitude of the Richter scale is used to express the power of an earthquake. The earthquake measuring 7 or more on a Richter scale is likely to cause severe damage to life and property.,Causes

Paragraph ,Ans Types
"Electrically Neutral State of Matter:
Most of the matters are present in electrically neutral state in nature. To understand this, let us recall the basics of atomic structure. An atom is made up of electrons, protons and neutrons. An electron carries a negative charge, a proton carries a positive charge and there is no charge on a proton. In an electrically neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Thus, the equal numbers of negative and positive charges balance each other. Most of the matters remain in electrically neutral state because of this reason.","Property, Reasoning, Types"
"Transfer of Charge: When certain objects are rubbed against another object, electrons may get transferred from one object to another. If an object loses some electron, it is left with surplus number of protons. Thus, this object becomes positively charged. If an object gains electrons, it now has surplus number of electrons. Thus, this object becomes negatively charged. The transfer of charges is responsible for static electricity in various objects. Static electricity is the main reason of lightning.","Property, Reasoning, Causes"
"Interaction of Charges:
When a glass rod is rubbed against a silk cloth; both of them get charged. As per convention; the glass rod is supposed to be positively charged and the silk cloth is supposed to be negatively charged once they are rubbed against each other","Effects, Reasoning"

It is observed that the refill attracts the bits of paper. This activity shows that a charged object attracts uncharged object.,"Property, Reasoning, Examples"
Take a comb and rub it vigorously in your hairs. Your hairs should be completely dry during this activity. Bring this comb near bits of paper. It is observed that the refill attracts the bits of paper. This activity shows that a charged object attracts uncharged object.,"Property, Reasoning, Examples"
Like charges repel each other: Take two plastic balls and suspend them near each other. Rub a glass rod to induce charge in it. Touch both the balls with this glass rod. It is observed that the plastic balls move away from each other. This activity shows that like charges repel each other.,"Property, Reasoning, Examples"
Unlike charges attract each other: Take two plastic balls and suspend them near each other. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth. Touch one of the balls with the glass rod and touch another ball with the silk cloth. It is observed that both the balls move towards each other. This activity shows that unlike charges attract each other.,"Property, Reasoning, Examples"
"Electroscope
Electroscope is a simple device which is used to test the presence of charge in an object. The gold-leaf electroscope was developed in 1787 by a British scientist named Abraham Bennet. Gold and silver are among the best conductors of electric current and hence leaves of these metals are used in electroscope.","Property, Reasoning"
Structure of Electroscope: It is made of a glass jar. A vertical brass rod is inserted into the jar through a cork. The top of the brass rod has a horizontal brass rod or a brass disc. Two gold leaves are suspended from the brass rod; inside the jar.,Property
"Working of Electroscope: When the brass disc of the electroscope is touched with a charged object, electric charge gets transferred to the gold leaf through the rod. This results in the gold leaves moving away from each other. This happens because both the leaves have similar charges.",Reasoning
"Charging: Transfer of charge from one object to another is called charging. In case of the gold leaves; charge is transferred through the brass rods. Hence, it can be said that charging can happen through metals.","Definition, Examples"
"Electrical Discharge: In the above activity, the gold leaves resume their normal position after some time. This happens because they lose their charge. This process is called electrical discharge. The gold leaves would also be discharged when someone touches the brass rod with bare hands. In that case, the charge is transferred to the earth through the human body.",Reasoning
Earthing: The process of transfer of charge to the earth is called earthing.,Definition 
Lightning is observed as a bright streak of light during a thunderstorm. Lightning is always accompanied by the sound of thunder. The transfer of charge from clouds to the earth or from cloud to cloud is called lightning. In simple words; lightning is an electric spark which happens on a grand scale in the sky.,"Property, Causes"
"Mechanism of Lightning
During a thunderstorm, the air currents move upward and water droplets move downward. These movements take at very fast pace and it results in separation of charges in the clouds.
The positive charges accumulate at the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate at the lower edges of the clouds. Scientists are yet to understand the exact reason for this.
At the same time, the ground becomes positively charged.
",Causes
"Air is a bad conductor of electricity under normal circumstances. But when the amount of charge becomes too much in the clouds, the air is not in a position to hold on to this charge. As a result, the electric charge is transferred to the ground. This appears like a bright streak of light across the sky; which lasts for a few seconds.","Property, Reasoning"
"Dangers of Lightning:
Lightning can damage houses and trees. It can also kill people and cattle. Sometimes, lightning can main a person for life",Effects 
"Safety During Lightning:
No open place is safe during lightning and hence a home or any other building is the safest place during lightning.
The first sound of thunder is like a warning call for lightning. Hence, one should rush to a building soon after hearing a sound of thunder. One should come out of home only a few minutes after the last sound of thunder.
You should not carry an umbrella (with a metallic handle) during thunderstorm. Metallic handle can be a potential target for lightning.
Tall trees and other tall structures are more prone to be hit by lightning. If you are caught in the open, try to hide under a short tree.
If you are in open and have no place to hide, then crouch on the ground and keep your head between your knees and hands.
Don’t take shower during lightning.
Use of phone should be avoided during lightning.
Television should be disconnected from the antenna.
Avoid operating the electric switches during lightning.","Property, Reasoning"
"Lightning Conductor:
This is a simple device which protects a building from being hit by lightning. It is composed of a vertical metallic rod which usually has a trident at the top. The base of the metallic rod is attached to thick metallic wire; which goes very deep inside the earth. This metallic wire provides a passage for earthing.",Property
"When lightning strikes, electric charge goes to the lightning conductor and it then goes to earth. Thus, a lightning conductor helps in preventing any damage to the building.",Reasoning
"Earthquake
Sudden shaking of the earth; which lasts for a very short duration is called earthquake.",Definition
Tectonic Plates: The crust of the earth is composed of several pieces of landmass. These are called tectonic plates. The tectonic plates are in continuous motion. They keep on brushing against each other or striking each other. When a tectonic plate brushes against another or strikes another tectonic plate; it results in vibrations in the tectonic plates. These vibrations are experienced by us in the form of an earthquake.,"Definition, Property"
"Seismic or Fault Zones: The boundaries of the tectonic plates are at high risk of earthquake. These boundaries are called seismic zones or fault zones. In India; Kashmir, western and central Himalayas, the whole of the north-east, Runn of Kutch, Rajasthan and Indo-Gangetic Plain are at high risk of getting hit by an earthquake. Some parts of the Deccan Plateau are under the seismic zone.","Definition, Property, Example"
"Seismograph: Seismograph is a device which records the seismic activities. It is composed of an oscillator, writing device and a roll of paper. The writing device is attached to the oscillator. In case of an earthquake, the oscillator begins to oscillate. This creates oscillation in the writing device; which plots wave-like patterns on the paper. The wave-like pattern is then analysed by seismologist to interpret the various features of an earthquake.","Property, Reasoning"
Richter Scale: The Richter Scale was developed in 1935 by Charles Richter and Beno Gutenberg of California Institute of Technology. This is a logarithmic scale which shows the intensity of an earthquake. The intensity of an earthquake is measured on a scale of zero to 10. But earthquakes of more than 9 Richter have never been reported. The magnitude of earthquake increases by 100 times when we move one point on the Richter scale. This means that an earthquake measuring 5 on Richter scale is 100 times more powerful than one measuring 4 on Richter scale.,"Property, Reasoning"
Most of the earthquakes go unnoticed by us because they are below 4 on Richter Scale. Earthquakes which measure more than 7.5 on the Richter scale can be highly damaging.,"Causes, Effects"
"Dangers Due to Earthquake
An earthquake cannot cause any damage on its own. Most of the damages caused by an earthquake are because of collapse of man-made structures; like buildings, bridges, poles, etc. Sometimes, an earthquake can result in tsunami which causes large scale damage. The infamous tsunami in the Indian Ocean which came on 26th December 2004 was because of a massive earthquake near Java.","Effects, Examples"
"Protection Against Earthquake:
It is impossible to predict an earthquake and hence we need to take several precautionary measures to avoid or minimize the damage which may happen because of earthquake.",Reasoning
"Some of the preventive measures are as follows:

Buildings should be made quake proof. Engineers and architects are the experts who can give suitable advice in this regard.
Light-weight materials should be used for making the buildings in earthquake prone areas.
Cupboards should be fixed to the walls so that they do not fall on someone during an earthquake.
People should be made to practice drills for earthquake. Such drills should be frequently organized in schools and at public places.
In case of an earthquake, you should hide under a table or any other similar structure. If you are in bed, then keep a pillow over your head and do not move out of the bed. If you are in an open area, try to move away from buildings and other structures.
Proper installation of fire-fighting equipments should be ensured in buildings. Fire due to short circuit and gas leakage is quite common during an earthquake.

Human Eye 
Let's understand how the human eye helps us in seeing objects. The eye is roughly spherical in shape.
Light mainly falls on the cornea - the white clear front part of the eye. It is tough and protects the interior of the eye from accidents.
The iris (a muscular structure behind the cornea) of the eye controls the amount of light reaching the interior of the eye by automatically adjusting the size of the pupil. (The iris is that part of the eye which gives it the colour such as black, brown, green eyes commonly called cat-eyes etc)
The eye's crystalline biconvex shaped lens is located behind the pupil. It further focuses the light on the retina. The retina contains several nerve cells which convert the optical images to signals to the brain via the optic nerve.
There are 2 types of nerve cells. (i) Cones : which are sensitive to bright light and help us recognize color (ii) Rods: which are sensitive to dim light.
The brain then decodes this signal as the image we see!
Note : The light is focused by the cornea, then the iris by controlling the opening of the pupil and then the lens. In dim light, your pupil expands to allow more light to enter your eye. In bright light, it contracts.

While reading, read at nominal distance of approximately 25cm. Holding the book too close or too far can cause strain.
Exercise similar precaution while watching TV, using laptops, iPads, Tablets
Never rub your eyes too hard. Wash your eyes frequently with clean water. If the irritation persists, see a doctor immediately.

"We see objects only when light coming from objects enters our eyes. Eye is one of our most important sense organs which give us the sense of vision. 

",Causes
"1. Cornea: It is located at the front portion of the eye. It is transparent window that bulges outwards and responsible for the maximum refraction (bending) of the light that enters the eye. 

2. Iris: It is a thin circular, colour part structure. It works like the shutter of eye. It controls the amount of light entering the eye.

3. Pupil: It is an adjustable circular opening that is located at the centre of the iris. Light enters into eye through the pupil. When the light amount is high, iris contracts and allows less light into the eye. When the light amount is low, iris dilates and allows more light into the eye.

4. Lens: It is made of a jelly transparent material and is a biconvex structure. It is present behind the pupil. The size and thickness of the lens change as per the distance of an object by the ciliary muscle.

5. Retina: The screen of eye is referred to as retina because the light ray comes through the pupil and passes through the lens and converges on a screen called retina. Retina is the light – sensitive inner lining of the back of the eye.
Retina contains several nerve cells. There are two kinds of cells
(i) Cone cells, which are sensitive to bright light and sense colour.
(ii)Rods cells, which are sensitive to dim light.

6. Optic Nerve: It is located at the back of the eye. Optic nerves are the bundle of over one million nerves fibres that carry visual messages from the retina to the brain.

7. Blind Spot: It is the small region where the optic nerve and the retina meet. It has no sensory cells. Hence no image is formed at this spot on the retina.

(iii) The adjusted light passes through the eye’s natural crystalline lens.
(iv) The eye lens converges all the light rays on the retina and images is formed on retina real, small and inverted.

When the reflected rays are not parallel to each other; this case of reflection is called irregular reflection. Irregular reflection happens from a rough surface. The laws of reflection are obeyed in this case as well but because of the irregularities in the surface, the reflected rays are not parallel. We get to see somewhat blurred images when image is formed by irregular reflection. The relative clarity of an image depends on the relative smoothness of the reflecting surface.","Definition, Property"
"Multiple Images: When two or more mirrors are placed at some angles to each other, we get to see multiple images. Let us take an example in which two mirrors are placed opposite to each other. If an object is placed between them, its image is formed in both the mirrors. The image in one mirror would act as an object for another mirror and this sequence would continue. This will result in the formation of multiple images.

The number of images formed depends on the angle between the two mirrors. This can be calculated by using the following formula:

Number of Images = (360/Angle) – 1

So, if the given mirrors are at a right angle to each other, 3 images will be formed. If the given mirrors are at 30° angle, we shall get 11 images. When the mirrors are kept opposite and parallel to each other, there would be infinite number of images formed.","Property, Formula, Relation"
"Human Eye
Eyes are the sense organs which give us the sense of vision. The human eye is almost spherical in shape. ","Definition, Property"
"Cornea: The eyeball is covered with a tough layer. This layer is transparent on the front. This transparent portion is called cornea.

","Definition, Property"
Iris: Iris is a thin circular structure. It works like the shutter of a camera. It controls the amount of light entering the eye. The colour of iris imparts distinct colour to the eyes of an individual. A person with blue iris has blue eyes,"Definition, Property"
"Pupil: There is a hole in the centre of iris. This is called pupil. Light enters the eye through the pupil. When the light is bright, iris contracts and thus allows less light into the eye. When the light is dim, iris dilates and thus allows more light into the eye.","Definition, Property"
Lens: Lens is present behind the pupil. The lens in the human eye is a convex lens. The size and thickness of the lens change as per the distance of an object.,"Definition, Property"
"Retina: Retina is at the back of the eye and marks the inner layer of the eyeball. Images are formed on the retina and thus it works like a screen. There are photosensitive cells in the retina. These cells are of two types, which are as follows:

Cone Cells: The cone cells are sensitive to bright light. They also give the sense of colour.
Rod Cells: The rod cells are sensitive to dim light.
","Definition, Property, Types"
Optic Nerve: The optic nerve emerges from the back of the eye ball. This nerve goes to the brain.,"Definition, Property"
"Blind Spot: The junction of retina and the optic nerve is called the blind spot. There is no photosensitive cell at this spot, and hence no image is formed at this spot on the retina.","Definition, Property"
"Persistence of Vision
An image stays on the retina for about 1/16 of a second. This feature is called persistence of vision. Due to this, when many still images are shown in a sequence; they give the illusion of moving images. Movies and animation are made by exploiting this property of the human eye.","Definition, Property, Effects"
"Care of Eyes
Eyes are very important organ and they are sensitive too. So, proper care of eyes is very important. Some tips for care of eyes are as follows:

Do not read in too bright or too dim light.
Do not look directly at a bright object or at the sun.
Do not keep the book too close to your eyes; while reading. Don’t keep the book too far either.
If something gets into the eye, do not rub the eye. Wash it with cold water.
In case of any problem; like itching or burning sensation; consult an ophthalmologist. A doctor who specializes in the disease of eyes is called an ophthalmologist.","Reasoning, Definition"
Myopia: A person suffering from myopia finds it difficult to see a distant object. This disease is also called short sightedness or near sightedness. Spectacles with suitable lenses can improve the vision in a myopic person.,"Definition, Property"
Hypermetropia: A person suffering from hypermetropia finds it difficult to see a nearby object. This disease is also called long sightedness. Spectacles with suitable lenses can improve the vision in a hypermetropic person.,"Definition, Property"
"Cataract: The cornea becomes cloudy in a cataract patient and thus the person cannot see clearly. Cataract is treated by surgery. In cataract surgery, the cornea is cleaned and an artificial lens is transplanted in the eye.","Definition, Property"
"Some people face with disability of vision. This disability can be partial or complete. Such persons are called visually challenged persons. For a visually challenged person; life can be very difficult. These people usually show a marked development of other senses; like the sense of hearing and sense of touch. Many aids have been devised to make their life easy. They can be divided into two categories, viz. optical and non-optical aids.","Definition, Property, Types"
"Optical Aids: Optical aids can help a person who is partially visually challenged. These aids enlarge an image or a text so that they could be visible. TV monitors, magnifying devices and telescopic devices come under this category.

","Property, Examples"
Non-optical Aids: Non-optical aids are helpful for a person who is completely visually challenged. These aids rely on the senses of hearing and touch. Aids which rely on the sense of touch are called tactual aids. Tactile buttons on the pedestrian light and in public transport are examples of tactual aids. Tactile strips at the edge of the platforms are also meant for visually challenged persons. Even the currency notes have tactile markings so that a visually challenged person can recognize notes of different denominations.,"Property, Reasoning"
Louis Braille Louis Braille was born in 1809 in France. He became blind during early childhood because of an accident. He developed the Braille script in 1824.,Reasoning
Braille Script: The Braille scripts are written in the form of raised dots. This system is composed of 63 characters. Each character is written on a grid of 6 cells. This can be written with the help of Braille slate and stylus. A reader needs to touch the Braille script to read it.,"Definition, Property"
Light: The natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible. Light is reflected from all surfaces. It is a form of energy.,"Definition, Property"
"Objects that give out light on their own are called luminous objects. Objects that do not give out light on their own are called non-luminous objects. They just reflect light that falls on them. When light reflected from an object enters into our eyes, the object becomes visible to us.","Definition, Property"
"Reflection of Light: Bouncing back of light after striking a shiny or polished surface, in the same medium, is called reflection",Definition
"Types of Reflection:

(i)  Regular Reflection: When a beam of parallel light rays is incident on a smooth and plane surface, the reflected rays will also be parallel. This type of reflection is called Regular Reflection. The reflection from a plane mirror is an example of regular reflection.

(ii)  Diffused or Irregular Reflection: When light is incident upon a rough or uneven surface, it is reflected in many directions due to presence of irregularities on that surface.","Types, Definition, Examples"
"If a reflected light ray is reflected again on being incident on another surface, it is termed multiple reflections. Multiple reflections are used in periscopes. Periscopes are used in submarines, war tanks and by soldiers in bunkers to see objects that are not visible directly. In a kaleidoscope, beautiful patterns are formed due to multiple reflections.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"Laws of reflection

The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
Incident ray, reflected ray and the normal drawn at the point of incidence to the reflecting surface, lie in the same plane.",Property
Lateral inversion is the effect produced by a plane mirror in reversing images from left to right. For e.g. our left hand will appear as right and vice versa.,"Definition, Effects, Examples"
"The image formed by a plane mirror is:

of the same size as that of the object
left-right inverted
erect and virtual
formed behind the mirror at the same distance as the distance of the object in front of the mirror",Property
"Two mirrors inclined to each other give multiple images.
Sunlight, called white light, consists of seven colours.
Splitting of light into its constituent colours is known as dispersion.
A normal eye can see nearby and distant objects clearly.

Visually challenged persons develop their other senses more sharply to improve their interaction with their environment.",Property
"Parts of Human Eye:
(i) Cornea: Transparent bulge on the front surface of the eyeball which protects the eye and helps in refraction of light.
(ii) Iris: Coloured diaphragm behind the cornea which controls the amount of light entering the eye.
(iii) Pupil: Dark hole in the middle of iris through which light enters the eye.
(iv) Eye lens: Transparent, crystalline structure behind pupil and iris.
(v) Ciliary muscles: Hole the eye lens in position and control the focal length of the eye lens.
(vi) Retina: Surface of the rear part of the eyeball where the light entering the eye is focused.
(vii) Rods and Cones: Rod cells respond to the brightness of light while cone cells respond to colours.
(viii) Blind spot: It is the least sensitive point where no rods and cones are present.
(ix) The space between the cornea and the eye lens is filled with aqueous humour.
(x) The space between the eye lens and the retina is filled with vitreous humour.",Definition
