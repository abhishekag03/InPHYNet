"Sources Of Light :

Any object that gives out light is called a source of light. Luminous objects are also called sources of light. Sources of light can be natural or artificial (man-made) ","Definition, Property"
"Examples of natural sources of light are ‘he sun and other stairs and insects like the firefly. Some artificial sources of light are candle, electric bulb, and laser.",Examples
"Materials that allow light to pass through significant scattering or absorption [Fig. 13.2(a)] are called transparent materials. We will be able to see through these materials very clearly. Examples of transparent materials are clear air, clear glass, clean water, some kinds of plastic, and cellophane paper.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Materials that allow light to pass through them, but scatter or diffuse the light as it passes through, i.e., a parallel beam of light comes through in all directions are called translucent materials [Fig. 13.2(b)], That is why an object cannot be seen clearly through a translucent material. Examples of translucent materials are butter paper, a frosted glass, paper smeared with oil, and smoked glass.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Materials that completely block light are called opaque materials [Fig. 13.2(c)]. We will not be able to see through these materials at all. Examples of an opaque materials are metal, mud, cement, coal, and wood. A mirror is a very good example of opaque material. An ideal mirror does not let any light pass through it","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Propagation Of Light :Usually light travels in a straight line. When we want to represent the propagation of light with a diagram, we represent it with the help of rays and beams.","Definition, Property"
"The property of light to travel in straight lines explains many interesting phenomena related to light, like formation of shadows by opaque objects and formation of images in a pin-hole camera.",Property
"Shadows :

An opaque object blocks the light falling on it. This creates an area of darkness on the side of the object away from the source of light. A translucent object also creates a faint area of darkness. An area of darkness formed by an opaque object obstructing light is called a shadow.","Definition, Property"
"The following three things are required for a shadow to form : a source of light
• an opaque object
• a screen or irface behind the object.",Types
"A shadow will not form if any of these is absent. This explains why we cannot see a shadow in the dark. It is only when light rays are obstructed by an opaque object that we get a shadow of the object.
Let us perform an activity to learn about the characteristics of a shadow.",Reasoning
"Characteristics of a Shadow:
A shadow has the following three characteristics:
1. It is always black, regardless of the colour of the object used to make the shadow
2. It only shows the shape or outline of the object and not the details.
3. The size of a shadow varies depending on the distance between the object and the source of light, and the distance between the object and the screen.",Property
"Reflection Surfaces :
We say light is reflected when it bounces off a surface. Reflection of light helps us to see most of the things around us.
Reflection of light by a surface depends on the nature of the surface. A rough and bumpy surface (also called an irregular surface) reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in different directions (Fig.
13.5). A good example of a rough surface is bark of a tree and blanket. This kind of reflection is called diffused reflection.",":Property, Definition"
"A smooth surface (a highly polished surface) reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in one direction. (Fig. 13.6). A good example of a smooth surface is a mirror. When you stand in front of a mirror, you can see yourself in the mirror. This is called your image.","Property, Effects"
"A very interesting phenomenon occurs when an object forms an image by reflection. This is something all of us must have noticed while seeing ourselves in the mirror. When we lift our right hand, the image in the mirror appears to lift its left hand. This seeming left-right reversal is called lateral inversion",Reasoning
"A pin-hole camera is just a box (Fig. 13.7) with a very tiny hole on one of its sides. Light falls on the hole, and an inverted image is formed on the side opposite to the hole. The human eye acts very much like a pin-hole camera.","Property, Reasoning"
Life without electricity is difficult to imagine. Many devices and machines in our day-to-day life run on electricity.,Property
"Things that run on electricity have electric current passing through them. In this, chapter, you will learn about electric current, what is needed to produce it, the conditions required to make an electric current flow, and the materials through which current can flow. You will learn some very interesting things like how to make a small bulb glow and how to make an electric switch",Property
"Most of the devices and machines we use like an electric iron, oven, room heater, refrigerator, ceiling fan or an electric bulb work when an electric current flows through them.
",Property
"With help from an adult, look at what is inside a transparent electric bulb (Fig. 14.1). Among other things, you will see that it has a thin filament (a very thin metal wire). The filament heats up when an electric current is passed through it. It heats up so much that it begins to glow and give out light.
","Property, Causes"
"A device that can be used to produce an electric current is called a source of electric current. Common sources of electric current are cells and batteries (collection of cells) which comes in various shapes and sizes (Fig. 14.2), and electric current that we get from plug points in houses. A very useful kind of cell which we use very often is the dry cell. Due to a chemical reaction that takes place in cells and batteries, electric current is produced.","Example, Definition, Effects"
"A dry cell is a very convenient source of electric current. The dry cell, as its name suggests, contains dry or semi-solid ingredients.","Property,  Definition"
"Different Types of Electric Cells:
Apart from the simple primary cells like dry cell, there are different types of electric cells. Different cells use different methods for producing an electric current. Primary cells can be used only once, and have to be thrown away once they have been used up.
","Types, Definition"
"There are cells that can be recharged once they are drained. These are called secondary cells. They are used in mobile phones, laptops, and car batteries.","Definition, Property"
"Nowadays, solar cells are being used in many applications. Solar cells use sunlight to produce electric current. Fig. 14.4 Some devices that work on dry cell.
Many calculators are powered with solar cells. Solar panels made up of solar cells are used to light up streets and many homes.","Examples, Property"
"Three basic conditions (Fig. 14.5) are required for an electric current to flow.
• A device used to produce an electric current like cell, battery, or a plug point acting as a source.
• A wire made of a metal like copper, silver, or aluminium, which will allow electric current to flow through easily.
• An unbroken loop (of the wire) running from one terminal of the source, through various appliances, back to the other terminal of the source.",Property
"When we connect the terminals of a pencil cell (name given to the cell due to its shape) to a bulb using two wires, the bulb glows. This happens because we provide a path for the current to flow. A path for an electric current to flow is called an electric circuit.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"In Figure 14.6(a), one wire from the pencil cell is connected to the torch bulb, while the other wire is not. The electric circuit is not complete here. In Figure 14.6(b), both the wires from the cell are connected to the torch bulb. The electric circuit is complete in this case. Electric current flows only if there is an unbroken path or closed circuit starting from one terminal of the source, through the torch bulb, to the other terminal of the source. Thus, the bulb glows in Figure 14.6(b) but not in Figure 14.6(a). The circuit in Figure 14.6(a) is not complete. Hence, current cannot flow through the circuit and the bulb does not glow. Such a circuit is called an open circuit. The circuit in Figure 14.6(b) is complete. Electric current flows through the circuit and, as a result, the bulb glows. Such a circuit is called a closed circuit.","Reasoning, Property"
"Electric current flows in a particular direction. In an electric circuit, the electric current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the electric cell. Figure 14.7 shows the direction of flow of electric current in a circuit.",Property
"An electric switch is a device that is used to open or close an electric circuit. When we open an electric circuit, the flow of electric current in the circuit stops [Fig. 14.9(a)], and when we close an electric circuit, an electric current flows through it [Fig. 14.9(b)]. In an electrical circuit, a switch is sometimes.","Definition, Property"
"A schematic diagram of an electric torch is shown in Fig. 14.10. An electric torch has one or more dry cells inside it, which act as the ‘source’. These cells are connected through a switch to a small bulb. When the switch is pushed to the ‘on’ position, the circuit is complete and the bulb glows. When the switch is pushed to the ‘off’ position, the circuit is incomplete (broken). Now the current cannot flow through the circuit, and the light goes out",Property
"Look at Figures 14.11(a)-(d). Each shows a complete electric circuit. Then why is it that the bulb glows only in circuits (b) and (d)? It is because not all materials allow electric current to pass through them.
A material that allows electric current to pass through it is called a conductor of electricity like the key and the safety pin [Figs. 14.11(b) and (d)]. A material that does not allow electric current to pass through it is called an insulator of electricity like the rubber band and the plastic pen [Figs. 14.11(a) and (c)].","Property, Causes"
"All metals are conductors of electricity while some are better conductors than others. A few non-metals like graphite (pencil lead is made of graphite) are also conductors of electricity.
Examples of insulators are glass, wood, rubber, pure water, and dry air. Flowever, the smallest impurity in water (impurities are substances like salts, dissolved in water) makes it a conductor.
The handles of screwdrivers and testers used by electricians are usually made of wood or hard plastic. They also wear rubber gloves while repairing an electric switch to avoid electric shock.","Causues, Property"
"Electricity can be very dangerous, if you do not handle electrical devices carefully. One should never play with electrical wires and sockets. Electricity from cells is safe and you can experiment with it, but you have to be careful not to connect the two terminals of a cell directly through a wire/conductor. Electricity generated by portable generators is dangerous and should not be used for experiments.",Property
"According to a legend, the first magnet was discovered by a Greek shepherd named Magnes. It is said that the nails in his shoes and the iron tip of his staff got stuck to a large black rock on which he was standing. Greeks named this strange type of rock ‘magnetite’. The Chinese also knew about magnets. Ancient Chinese sailors used magnets for navigation.","Property, Definition"
"Magnets are made of materials that attract objects made of certain substances like iron, cobalt, and nickel.
Magnets come in various shapes and sizes (Fig. 12.1). They can be found as horseshoe, ring, cylindrical, or bar shape.","Property, Examples"
"Not all objects are attracted to magnets. Objects that are attracted by a magnet are said to be magnetic, e.g., iron and nickel. Objects that are not attracted by a magnet, are said to be non-magnetic, e.g., wood and plastic.","Defintion, Examples"
"When magnetic materials (like iron filings) are brought close to a magnet, they do not stick evenly to all parts of the magnet. They stick more on certain parts of the magnet. These are called the poles of the magnet. Magnetic forces are the strongest at the poles. For example, the two ends of a bar magnet are its poles.","Property, Examples"
"There are two types of poles in every magnet, irrespective of its shape. These are, by convention, called the North Pole (N) and the South Pole (S) (Fig. 12.2). The two poles cannot exist independently. That is, they always come in pairs.
If we break a bar magnet in the middle, we would get two pieces, each having a North Pole and a South Pole. We could go on breaking the magnet into smaller pieces, and everytime we would get both the poles in each piece.","Property, Definition"
"If a magnet is allowed to move freely, it comes to rest in a direction very close to the Earth’s North-South direction. This property of a magnet was used to find directions on the surface of the Earth by travellers. An instrument with a magnet that is used to find directions is called magnetic compass.",Property
"It has a small magnetic needle at its centre. This needle can rotate freely and always points in the Earth’s North-South direction. Different directions (north, south, east, and west) are marked on the compass. Figure 12.3 shows how one can find directions using a magnetic compass","Reasoning, Property"
"Do you know why a freely suspended magnet always points in the Earth’s north-south direction? It behaves like it is under the influence of another magnet. But where is this other magnet? It is the Earth itself. This alignment happens because of the influence of the Earth, which itself acts like a giant bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). It influences all the magnets (within its region of influence) to align themselves along its North-South direction.","Reasoning, Property"
"When two magnets are brought close to each other, they are either pulled towards each other, or pushed away from each other. When the magnets are pulled towards each other, they are said to attract each other. When they are pushed away from each other, they are said to repel each other. Whether the magnets attract or repel depends on which poles of the magnets are facing each other.","Defintion, Property, Reasoning"
"When like poles of the magnets (N-N or S-S) are brought close to each other, they repel. This is called repulsion.
","Definition, Property"
"When unlike poles of the magnets (N-S or S-N) are brought close to each other, they attract. This is called attraction","Definition, Property"
There are two types of magnets: temporary and permanent. Magnets that retain their magnetic properties only for a short period of time are called temporary magnets. Magnets that retain their magnetic properties for a long period of time are called permanent magnets.,"Types, Definition"
"Temporary magnets are usually made of iron, cobalt, or nickel. These materials behave like magnets only when they are near a strong magnet. They quickly lose their magnetic property if the influence of the strong magnet is removed.
:",Property
"Permanent magnets are made from mixtures of iron, cobalt, or nickel with other materials. These make strong magnets and retain their magnetic properties for a long time.",Property
"A magnet can lose its properties due to the following activities.
• Dropping from a height
• Hitting with a hammer
• Applying heat
• Improper storage can also cause loss of magnetic properties.",Causes
"Bar magnets should be stored in pairs, with Dropping from a height unlike poles alongside each other. A horseshoe magnet should be stored with a piece of soft iron kept across its poles.",Property
"Magnets have several uses:
1. Credit cards, ATM cards, and identity cards have a strip of magnetic material that stores information.
2. Television and computer monitors use magnets.
3. Computer hard discs and audio and video cassettes have magnetic material that store information.
4. Magnets are used in picking up substances made of iron from scrapyard.","Examples, Property"
"Transport is the mechanism by which a thing is carried from one place to another.

In the earlier times, land transport was done using animals or human backs, while, water transport was done on hollow wooden logs or simple wooden boats.
After the invention of wheel, bullock carts, chariots, camel carts were developed where animals used to pull vehicles.
Transport then evolved in the 19th and 20th century to bus, trains, cars, airplane, jets, steam and motor boats, etc.","Definition, Examples"
"Length tells us how long an object is while Distance gives the information as to how far two things are.

Before the invention of scales, length was measured with the help of random wooden sticks, hands or threads.
Similarly, distances were measured in days or time taken to reach from one place to another.","Examples, Property"
"Measurement is comparison on an unknown quantity with a known quantity. The known quantity is called Unit.

Measurement consists of two parts, a number (quantity) and a unit. Depending upon the unit, the number changes. For example, distance between point A and B is 4.5 Km or 2.79 miles.
If the length or distance is measured by the length of foot of a person, then the same length or distance will have different values as the length of foot of different people differ slightly.
In ancient times, cubit (length from elbow to finger tips), foot, distance between outstretched arm and chin were taken as the unit of length.","Definition, Examples, Property"
"Scientists all over the world have accepted a set of standard units for measurements. This system of units is called International System of Units (SI units).

In 1790, the French created a standard unit of measurement called the metric system.
SI unit of length is metre (m) while for large distances; the unit is kilometer (km).
1 km = 1000 m",Definition
"Below are a few pointers that need to be followed for taking correct measurements.

Use appropriate measuring instrument.For eg:
For measuring lengths of smaller straight objects like a pencil, a 15 inch scale should be used.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Use a whole (non-broken) instrument.If using an instrument with broken edges, start from the portion where the instrument is complete.",Property
Keep your eye at the correct position for taking the readings. Incorrect position may lead to slightly incorrect reading.,Reasoning
"A curved line or surface cannot be measured by a straight scale, a measuring tape or thread must be used instead.To measure a curved line using a thread, follow the below steps:

Tie a knot at one end of the thread.
Place the thread at the beginning of the line and try to measure a small initial portion of the line which is relatively straight.
Place your thumb at the other end of the measured portion and measure next straighter portion.
Repeat the above step till the end of line is reached. Make a knot at the end of the line.
Now, straighten the thread and measure the length of the two knots on a scale.","Property, Example"
"Objects which are moving around us are said to be in motion whereas the objects which are not moving are said to be at rest.

Any change in position with time can be termed as motion.
A motion can be termed as slow or fast based on the distance it covers in a specific amount of time. More distance covered means the motion is fast and vice versa.
Motion can be the complete object or the parts within it.
Objects like train, bird, hands of a clock, ants are moving objects whereas house, tree, wall clock are non-moving or stationary objects.","Definition, Property, Examples"

When an opaque object is placed in path of light, a dark portion is formed on the opposite side of object on the screen. This dark portion is shadow.
(1) The size of shadow depends on the distance of source of light and on the angle at which the light rays fall on the object.
(2) If the source of light is closer to the object, a larger shadow is formed than when the source of light is far from the object.
(3) The shadow can be seen only on a screen. The ground, walls of the rooms, a building, or other such surfaces act as a screen for the shadows you observe in everyday life
