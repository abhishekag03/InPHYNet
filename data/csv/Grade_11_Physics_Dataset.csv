According to Universal law of gravitation, the force between two bodies is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to a square of the distance. Mathematically it can be represented as follows: F∝m1m2r2⇒F=Gm1m2r2 where, F is the gravitational force between two bodies m1 is the mass of one object m2 is the mass of the second object r is the distance between the centers of two objects","Definition, Formula"
"This constant of proportionality is known as Universal Gravitation Constant. With careful experiments, the value of gravitational constant was found to be 6.67 x   N. This experiment was performed by Henry Cavendish. Also, the value of ‘G’ remains constant throughout the universe. Now the one question to be answered here, is how Newton was able to predict that the force is inversely proportional to square of the distance? For this, he utilized Kepler’s law according to which square of time period is directly proportional to cube times the distance between the center and the orbiting body. So we know since the body is in circular motion so, F∝v2r……………………….(1) Also we can say, T=2πrv⇒v=2πrT Now, putting the value of v in equation (1) we get, F∝rT2……………………….(2) Now from Kepler’s Law, T2∝r3. Hence, putting the value of T2 in equation(2), we get, F∝1r2","Property, Formula"
"Now the question is if gravitation exists between any two masses then why we are attracted towards the earth but not towards each other. To realize this let’s take an example let there be two bodies A (60 kg) and B (80 kg) at a distance of 1m from one another. So the gravitational pull between the two bodies is: F=Gm1m2r2⇒F=6.67×10−11×60×8012N⇒F=3.2×10−7N………………….(3) Now consider the force between body A and the earth. Mass = 6×1024 Kg. Radius of earth = 6.3×106 m. F=6.67×10−11×60×6×1024(6.3×106)2N⇒F=577.4N. By looking at (3) and (4), we can say that even though every bit of mass in the universe attracts every other bit, we don’t feel it because, under normal heights, the attraction is far too low to be felt. The Earth, on the other hand, is massive and hence exerts a non-zero force on us. The larger the planet, larger is its force of gravity.",Property

For example:-water which does not have its own shape but it takes the shape of the container in which it is poured. But when we pour water in a tumbler it takes the shape of the tumbler,"Definition, Examples"
"Both liquids and gases can be categorised as fluids as they are capable of flowing. Volume of solids,liquids and gas depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. In this chapter we will study if we apply force on the fluid how does it affects the internal properties of fluids. Fluids offer very little resistance to shear stress. We will also study some characteristic properties of fluids.",Property
Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Pressure = Force/Area. For Example:- Consider a very sharp needle which has a small surface area and consider a pencil whose back is very bluntand has more surface area than the needle. If we poke needle in our palm it will hurt as needle gets pierced inside our skin.Whereas if we poke the blunt side of the pencil into our hand it won’t pain so much. This is because area of contact between the palm and the needle is very small therefore the pressure is large. Whereas the area of contact between the pencil and the palm is more therefore the pressure is less.,"Definition, Formula"
Conclusion: Two factors which determine the magnitude of the pressure are:- Force – greater the force greater is the pressure and vice-versa. Coverage area –greater the area less is the pressure and vice-versa.,Property
Consider a stuntman lying on the bed of nails which means there are large numbers of nails on any rectangular slab. All the nails are identical and equal in height. We can see that the man is not feeling any pain and he is lying comfortably on the bed. This is because there isa large number of nails and all the nails are closely spaced with each other. All the small pointed nails make large surface area therefore the weight of the body is compensated by the entire area of all the nails. The surface area increases therefore pressure is reduced. But even if one nail is greater than the others then it will hurt. Because then the surface area will be less as a result pressure will be more. Stuntman lying on bed of nails.,Reasoning 
"Pressure in Fluids:- Normal force exerted by fluid per unit area. This means force is acting perpendicular to the surface of contact. Consider a body submerged in the water, force is exerted by the water perpendicular to the surface of the body. If there is no force applied perpendicularly but in the parallel direction then there will be motion along the horizontal direction. Since fluid is at rest and body is submerged in the fluid. Therefore there cannot be motion along the horizontal direction. Therefore we always say the force is applied perpendicularly. Pressure is a scalar quantity. Because the force here is not a vector quantity but it is the component of force normal to the area. Dimensional Formula [ML-1T-2] I Unit: N/m2 or Pascal(Pa). Atmosphere unit (atm) is defined as pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level.It is a common unit of pressure. 1atm=1.013x105 Pa
","Definition, Reasoning "
"Pascal’s Law. Pascal’s law states that if the pressure is applied to uniform fluids that are confined,the fluids will then transmit the same pressure in all directions at the same rate. Pascal’s law holds good only for uniform fluids.For example:- Consider a vessel filled with water which is uniform throughout as there is only one type of fluid which is water. Consider a vessel which has oil and water then it is not uniform.As it have two different fluids.","Definition, Reasoning "
"Fluid should be confined meaning fluid is present within region in space.It is not allowed to spread. For example 1:-
A balloon filled with water and when we press it hard against the wall. We will see the shape of the balloon changes. This is because if we apply force on balloon, pressure is exerted on the water.
Water is uniform fluid and it is confined with in this balloon and is not allowed to spread. On applying pressure it is transmitted in all other directions.",Examples
"For example 2:- Consider a vessel of circular shape filled with water which has 4 openings and in the entire openings 4 pistons are attached. Apply force on the first piston; this piston will move inward and all other pistons will move outwards. This happens because when this piston moves inwards the pressure is exerted on the water.Water transmits this pressure in all the directions. The other pistons,except A, moves at the same speed which shows water has exerted pressure in all the directions.","Reasoning , Examples"
"For a uniform fluid in equilibrium, pressure is same at all points in a horizontal plane. This means there is no net force acting on the fluid the pressure is same at all the points. A fluid moves due to the differences in pressure. That means fluid will always move from a point which is at a higher pressure to the point which is at a lower pressure.",Reasoning
"Variation of pressure with depth. Consider a cylindrical object inside a fluid;consider 2 different positions for this object. Fluid is at rest therefore the force along the horizontal direction is 0. Forces along the vertical direction:- Consider two positions 1 and 2. Force at position 1 is perpendicular to cross sectional area A, F1= P1. Similarly F2=P2. Total force Fnet= -F1+F2 as F1 is along negative y axis therefore it is –ive. And F2 is along +ive y -axis. Fnet =(P2-P1)A . This net force will be balanced by the weight of the cylinder(m). Therefore under equilibrium condition Fnet=mg=weight of the cylinder = weight of the fluid displaced. =ρ Vg where ρ=density=volume of the fluid =ρhAg   where V=hA(h=height and A= area) Therefore (P2-P1) A=ρhAg P2-P1 = ρhg,Therefore the difference in the pressure is dependent on height of the cylinder. Consider the top of the cylinder exposed to air therefore P1=Pa(where Pa= P1 is equal to atmospheric pressure.) Then P2=Pa+ ρhg. Conclusion: The pressure P, at depth below the surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is greater than atmospheric pressure by an amount ρhg. The pressure is independent of the cross sectional or base area or the shape of the container. Cylinder is inside the fluid.","Reasoning, Formula"
"Hydrostatic Paradox . Hydrostatic Paradox means: - hydro = water, static =at rest. Paradox meansthat something taking place surprisingly. Consider 3 vessels of very different shapes (like thin rectangular shape, triangular and some filter shape) and we have a source from which water enters into these 3 vessels. Water enters through the horizontal base which is the base of these 3 vessels we observe that the level of water in all the 3 vessels is same irrespective of their different shapes. This is because pressure at some point at the base of these 3 vessels is same. The water will rise in all these 3 vessels till the pressure at the top is same as the pressure at the bottom. As pressure is dependent only on height therefore in all the 3 vessels the height reached by the water is same irrespective of difference in their shapes. This experiment is known as Hydrostatic Paradox.","Definition, Reasoning "
Atmospheric Pressure. Pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. Atmosphere is a mixture of different gases. All these gas molecules together constitute some weight. By virtue of this weight there is some pressure exerted by the atmosphere on all the objects.This pressure is known as atmospheric pressure. Value of atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1.01*105. 1atm = 1.01*105Pa,Definition
"Atmospheric pressure is measured by Mercury Barometer. Mercury barometer consists of trough filled with mercury(Hg).There is a tube which also contains mercury and it is invertedinside the trough. The one end of tube is closed and other end of the tube is placed inverted inside the trough. The inverted tube which also contains mercury up to a certain level and the space above mercury in the tubeis occupied by the vapours of mercury. The pressure can be considered as 0 at this place. The atmosphere will exert some atmospheric pressure on the mercury level as a result the level of mercury decreases in the trough andit increases in the tube.This increase in level will determine how much pressure was exerted by the atmosphere. The pressure exerted is directly ∝to the increase in the mercury column of the tube. We can say that pressure at point A is same as pressure at point B.Patm=hρg. It is measured in terms of how many mm of Hg rose in the column. Greater the height greater is the atmospheric pressure. When the height in this column becomes 76cm Hg we can say that the pressure applied is equal to 1atm. After applying the pressure level of mercury rises in the tube.
",Reasoning
"Units of Pressure:- 1.SI unit: Pascal (Pa) Pressure is always measured by taking sea level as the reference level. At sea level P=1.01*105 Pa.
Atmosphere (atm) Reference level is at sea level. Pressure equivalent of 76cm of Hg column 1atm=76cm of Hg column 1atm=1.01*105 Pa

"Gauge Pressure Pressure difference between the system and the atmosphere. From relation P=Pa+ ρgh where P= pressure at any point, Pa = atmospheric pressure. We can say that Pressure at any point is always greater than the atmospheric pressure by the amount ρgh. P-Pa=ρgh where P =pressure of the system, Pa=atmospheric pressure, (P-Pa) = pressure difference between the system and atmosphere. hρg = Gauge pressure.","Definition, Formula"
"How to measure Gauge pressure. Gauge pressure is measured by Open Tube Manometer. Open Tube Manometer is a U-shaped tube which is partially filled with mercury(Hg). One end is open and other end is connected to some device where pressure is to be determined.This means it is like a system. The height to which the mercury column will rise depends on the atmospheric pressure. Similarly depending on the pressure of the system the height of mercury in another tube rises. The pressure difference between these two heights is the difference between the atmospheric pressure and system. This difference in pressure is the gauge pressure. Consider if the level of mercury column is same in both the U-tubes. Patm=P, therefore the difference between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure of the system is 0. Gauge Pressure is 0. Patm = 760torr.","Property, Reasoning"
"Absolute Pressure. Absolute pressure is defined as the pressure above the zero value of pressure. It is the actual pressure which a substance has. It is measured against the vacuum. Absolute pressure is measured relative to absolute zero pressure. It is sum of atmospheric pressure and gauge pressure. P =Pa+hρg where P = pressure at any point, Pa = atmospheric pressure and hρg= gauge pressure. Therefore P =Pa + Gauge Pressure. Where P = absolute pressure. It is measured with the help of barometer.","Definition, Formula"
"Pascal’s law for transmission of fluid pressure. Pascal’s law for transmission of fluid pressure states that thepressure exerted anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions throughout the fluid.The above law means that if we consider a fluid which is restricted within a specific region in space and if the volume of the fluid doesn’t change with the pressure,then the amount of pressure exerted will be same as the amount of pressure transmitted.Consider a circular vessel which have 4 openings and along these 4 openings 4 pistons are attached.When piston A is moved downwards pressure is exerted on the liquid in the downward direction, this pressure gets transmitted equally along all the directions. As a result all the other 3 pistons move equal distance outwards.","Reasoning, Definition"
A circular vessel fitted with movable piston at all the four ends and when piston A is moved downward a pressure is exerted downward. Equal amount of pressure is exerted along all the directions as a result they will move equal distances outward.,Reasoning
"Hydraulic lift:-

Hydraulic lift is a lift which makes use ofa fluid.
For example: Hydraulic lifts that are used in car service stations to lift the cars.
Principle: -
Inside a hydraulic lift there are 2 platforms,one has a smaller area and the other one has a larger area.
It is a tube like structure which is filled with uniform fluid.
There are 2 pistons (P1 and P2)which are attached at both the ends of the tube.
Cross-sectional area of piston P1 is A1 and of piston P2 is A2.
If we apply force F1 on P1, pressure gets exerted and according to Pascal’s law the pressure gets transmitted in all the directions and same pressure gets exerted on the other end.As a result the Piston P2 moves upwards.
Advantage of using hydraulic lift is that by applying small force on the small area we are able to generate a larger force.
Mathematically:- F2=PA2
where F2 = Resultant Force,A2 = area of cross-section
F2= (F1/A1)A2 where P=F1/A1 (Pressure P is due to force F1 on the area A1)
F2 =(A2/A1)F1. This shows that the applied force has increased by A2/A1.
Because of Pascal’s law the input gets magnified.

"Hydraulic Brakes

Hydraulic brakes work on the principle of Pascal’s law.
According to this law whenever pressure is applied on a fluid it travels uniformly in all the directions.
Therefore when we apply force on a small piston, pressure gets created which is transmitted through the fluid to a larger piston. As a result of this larger force,uniformbrakingis applied on all four wheels.
As braking force is generateddue to hydraulic pressure,theyare known as hydraulic brakes.
Liquids are used instead of gas as liquids are incompressible",Reasoning
"Construction

The fluid in the hydraulic brake is known as brake fluid.
It consists of a master cylinder, four wheel cylinders and pipes carrying brake fluid from master cylinder to wheel cylinders.
Master cylinder consists of a piston which is connected to pedal through connecting rod.

Each wheel brake consists of a cylinder brake drum. This drum is mounted on the inner side of wheel. The drum revolves with the wheel.
Two brake shoes whichare mounted inside the drum remain stationary.",Reasoning
"Working

When we press the brake pedal, piston in the master cylinder forces the brake fluid through a linkage.
As a result pressure increases and gets transmitted to all the pipes and to all the wheel cylinders according to Pascal’s law.
Because of this pressure,both the pistons move outand transmit the braking force on all the wheels.",Reasonong 
"Advantages:-

Equal braking effort to all the four wheels.
Less rate of wear due to absence of joints.
By just changing the size of one piston and cylinder, force can be increased or decreased",Property

Leakage of brake fluid spoils the brake shoes.
Even the slightest presence of air pockets can spoil the whole system.",Property
"Types of Fluid flow: Steady Flow



Some streamlines for fluid flow

The flow of a fluid is said to be steady, if at any point,the velocity of each passing fluid particle remains constant within that interval of time.
Streamline is the path followed by the fluid particle.
It means that at any particular instant the velocities of all the particles at any point are same.But the velocity of all the particles won’t be same across all the points in the space.
Steady flow is termed as ‘Streamline flow’ and ‘Laminar flow’.
Consider a case when all the particles of fluid passing point A have the same velocity. This means that the first particle will have velocity V1 and second will have velocity V1 and so on. All the particles will have the same velocity V1at point A.
At point B,all particleswill have velocity V2.
Similarly at point C the velocity of all the particles is V3.
We can see that the velocity is changing from point to point but at one particular point it is same.
No two streamlines can intersect.
If two streamlines intersect each other, the particleswon’t know which path to follow and what velocity to attain.That is why no two streamlines intersect.


The meaning of streamlines:- (a) A typicaltrajectory of a fluid particle.

(b) A region of streamline flow.","Types, Definition"
"Equation of Continuity

According to the equation of continuity Av = constant. Where A =cross-sectional area and v=velocity with which the fluid flows.
It means that if any liquid is flowing in streamline flow in a pipe of non-uniform cross-section area, then rate of flow of liquid across any cross-section remains constant.
Consider a fluid flowing through a tube of varying thickness.
Let the cross-sectional area at one end (I) = A1 and cross-sectional area of other end (II)= A2.
The velocity and density of the fluid at one end (I)=v1,ρ1respectively, velocity and densityof fluid at other end (II)= v2,ρ2
Volume covered by the fluid in a small interval of time ∆t,across left cross-sectional is Area (I) =A1xv1x∆t
Volume covered by the fluid in a small interval of time ∆tacrossright cross-sectional Area(II) = A2x v2x∆t
Fluid inside is incompressible(volume of fluid does not change by applying pressure) that is density remains sameρ1=ρ2. (equation 1)
Along(I) mass=ρ1 A1 v1∆t and along second point (II) mass = ρ2A2 v2∆t
By using equation (1). We can conclude that A1 v1 = A2 v2.This is the equation of continuity.
From Equation of continuity we can say that Av=constant.
This equation is also termed as “Conservation of mass of incompressible fluids”.","Definition, Formula"
"Volume flux/Flow rate remains constant throughout the pipe. This means rate of flow of fluid of liquidis more if cross-sectional area is more, then the velocity will be less,andvice-versa.
But the Av will remain constant.
So the volume which is covered by the fluid at any cross-sectional area is constant throughout the pipe even if pipe has different cross-sectional areas.
The fluid is accelerated while passing from the wider cross sectional area towards the narrower area. This means if area is more the velocity is less and vice-versa.","Definition, Formula, Reasonign"
"Turbulent Flow:

A fluid flow is said to be turbulent if the velocity of the particles vary at any point erratically.

All the particles are moving here and there randomly.",Definition

"Derive: Bernoulli’s equation

Assumptions:

Fluid flow through a pipe of varying width.

Fluid is incompressible.
Flow is laminar.
No energy is lost due to friction:applicable only to non-viscous fluids.
Mathematically: -
Consider the fluid initially lying between B and D. In an infinitesimal timeinterval Δt, this fluid would have moved.
Suppose v1= speed at B and v2= speedat D, initial distance moved by fluid from to C=v1Δt.
In the same interval Δtfluid distance moved by D to E = v2Δt.
P1= Pressureat A1, P2=Pressure at A2.
Work done on the fluid atleft end (BC) W1 = P1A1(v1Δt).
Work done by the fluid at the other end (DE)W2 = P2A2(v2Δt)
Net work done on the fluid is W1 – W2 = (P1A1v1Δt− P2A2v2Δt)
By the Equation of continuity Av=constant.
P1A1 v1Δt - P2A2v2Δt where A1v1Δt =P1ΔV and A2v2Δt = P2ΔV.
Therefore Work done = (P1− P2) ΔVequation (a)
Part of this work goes in changing Kinetic energy, ΔK = (½)m (v22 – v12) and part in gravitational potential energy,ΔU =mg (h2 − h1).
The total change in energy ΔE= ΔK +ΔU = (½) m (v22 – v12) + mg (h2 − h1). (i)
Density of the fluid ρ =m/V or m=ρV
Therefore in small interval of time Δt, small change in mass Δm
Δm=ρΔV (ii)
Putting the value from equation (ii) to (i)
ΔE = 1/2 ρΔV (v22 – v12) + ρgΔV (h2 − h1)  equation(b)
By using work-energy theorem: W = ΔE
From (a) and (b)
(P1-P2) ΔV =(1/2) ρΔV (v22 – v12) + ρgΔV (h2 − h1)
P1-P2 = 1/2ρv22 - 1/2ρv12+ρgh2 -ρgh1(By cancelling ΔV from both the sides).
After rearranging we get,P1 + (1/2) ρ v12 + ρg h1 = (1/2) ρ v22 + ρg h2
P+(1/2) ρv2+ρg h = constant.
This is the Bernoulli’s equation.

By puttingv1=v2=0 in the above equation changes to
P1-P2= ρg(h2-h1). This equation is same as when the fluids are at rest.
When the pipe is horizontal.h1=h2.This means there is no Potential energy by the virtue of height.

"By the equation of continuity, wherever the area is more velocity is less and vice-versa.As A1 is more this implies v1 is less and vice-versa.
Pressure is inversely ∝ to Therefore at A1 pressureP1 is less as compared to pressure P2 at A2.

"Dynamic Lift

Dynamic lift is the normal force that acts on a body by virtue of its motion through a fluid.
Consider an object which is moving through the fluid,and due to the motion of the object through the fluid there is a normal force which acts on the body.
This force is known as dynamic lift.
Dynamic lift is most popularly observed in aeroplanes.
Whenever an aeroplane is flying in the air, due to its motion through the fluid here fluid is air in the atmosphere.Due to its motion through this fluid, there is a normal force which acts on the body in the vertically upward direction.
This force is known as Dynamic lift.

Dynamic lift on airplane wings:-

Consider an aeroplane whose body is streamline.Below the wings of the aeroplane there is air which exerts an upward force on the wings.As a result aeroplane experiences dynamic lift.",Examples

Case1:-When the ball is not spinning.
The ball moves in the air it does not spin, the velocity of the ball above and below the ball is same.
As a result there is no pressure difference.(ΔP= 0).
Therefore there is no dynamic lift.","Reasoning, Examples"
"Case2:- When the ball is moving in the air as well as spinning.
When the ball spins it drags the air above it therefore the velocity above the ball is more as compared to the velocity below the ball.
As a result there is a pressure difference; the pressure is more below the ball.
Because of pressure difference there is an upward force which is the dynamic lift.",Reasoning 
"Viscosity is the property of a fluid that resists the force tending to cause the fluid to flow.
It is analogous to friction in solids.

Consider 2 glasses one filled with water and the other filled with honey.
Water will flow down the glass very rapidly whereas honey won’t.This is because honey is more viscous than water.
Therefore in order to make honey flow we need to apply greater amount of force. Because honey has the property to resist the motion.
Viscosity comes into play when there is relative motion between the layers of the fluid.The different layers are not moving at the same pace.","Definition, Examples"

Let retarding force F∝v where v =velocity of the sphere
F ∝ r where r=radius of the sphere
F∝η where η=coefficient of viscosity
6π=constant
Stokes law is applicable only to laminar flow of liquids.It is not applicable to turbulent law.
Example:-Falling raindrops
Consider a single rain drop, when rain drop is falling it is passing through air.
The air has some viscosity; there will be some force which will try to stop the motion of the rain drop.
Initially the rain drop accelerates but after some time it falls with constant velocity.
As the velocity increases the retarding force also increases.
There will be viscous force Fv and bind force Fbacting in the upward direction.There will also be Fggravitational force acting downwards.
After some time Fg = Fr (Fv+Fb)

d=diameter of the pipe through which the fluid flows
η=viscosity of the fluid.","Refinition, Reasoning"
"If the value of Reynold’s number (Re) reaches 1000 then the flow is laminar.
When the value of Reynold’s number(Re)is greater than 2000 then the flow is turbulent.

Certain properties of free surfaces:-
Whenever liquids are poured in any container they take the shape of that container in which they are poured and they acquire a free surface. 
Consider a case if we pour water inside the glass it takes the shape of the glass with a free surface at the top.
Top surface of the glass is a free surface. Water is not in contact with anything else,it is in contact with the air only.

"Surface Energy
Surface energy is the excess energy exhibited by the liquid molecules on the surface compared to those inside the liquid.

It acquires free surface.","Definition, Property"
"When molecules are inside the liquid:- 
Suppose there is a molecule inside the water,there will be several other molecules that will attract that molecule in all the directions.
As a result this attraction will bind all the molecules together.
This results in negative potential energy of the molecule as it binds the molecule.
To separate this molecule huge amount of energy is required to overcome potential energy.
Some external energy is required to move this molecule and it should be greater than the potential energy.
Therefore in order to separate this molecule a huge amount of energy is required.
Therefore a large amount of energy is required by the molecules which are inside the liquid.",Reasoning 
"When the molecules are at the surface:- 
When the molecule is at the surface, half of it will be inside and half of it is exposed to the atmosphere.
For the lower half of the molecule it will be attracted by the other molecules inside the liquid.
But the upper half is free. The negative potential energy is only because of lower half.
But the magnitude is half as compared to the potential energy of the molecule which is fully inside the liquid.
So the molecule has some excess energy, because of this additional energy which the molecules have at the surface different phenomenon happen like surface energy, surface tension.
Liquids always tend to have least surface are when left to itself.
As more surface area will require more energy as a result liquids tend to have least surface area.",Reasoning

Surface tension is the property of the liquid surface which arises due to the fact that surface molecules have extra energy.
Surface energy is the extra energy which the molecules at the surface have.
Surface tension is the property of the liquid surface because the molecules have extra energy.
Surface energy is defined as surface energy per unit area of the liquid surface.
Denoted by ’S’.
Mathematically :- 
Consider a case in which liquid is enclosed in a movable bar.
Slide the bar slightly and it moves some distance (‘d’).
There will be increase in the area, (dl) where l=length of the bar.
Liquids have two surfaces one on the bar and other above the bar. Therefore area=2(dl)
Work done for this change =Fxdisplacement.
Surface tension(S)=Surface Energy/area
Or Surface Energy=S x area
=Sx2dl
Therefore S x 2dl =F x d
S = F/2d
Surface tension is the surface energy per unit area of the liquid surface.
It can be also defined as Force per unit length on the liquid surface.
Important: -At any interface (it is a line which separates two different medium) the surface tension always acts in equal and opposite direction and it is always perpendicular to the line at the interface.Schematic picture of molecules in a liquid, at the surface and balance of forces

"Consider a molecule which is present completely inside the liquid and if it is strongly attracted by the neighbouring molecules then the surface energy is less.
Consider a molecule which is present partially inside the liquid the force of attraction by the neighbouring molecules is lesser as a result surface energy is more.
Consider a molecule whose very little part is inside the water so very small force of attraction by the neighbouring molecules as a result more surface energy.
Conclusion: - A fluid will stick to a solid surface if the surface energy between fluid and solid is smaller than the sum of energies between solid-air and fluid-air.
This means Ssf( solid fluid) < Sfa(fluid air) + Ssa(Solid air)",Reasoning 
"Why does water stick to glass but mercury doesn’t?
In case of water and glass, water sticks to glass because the surface energy of waterand glass is less than the surface energy between water and air and between glass and air. S.E(w-g)< S.E(w-a)+S.E(g-a)
In case of mercury, Surface Energy between mercury and glass S.E(m-g), Surface energy between mercury and air S.E (m-a), and Surface Energy between air and glass S.E (a-g). E (m-g)> S.E(m-a)+S.E (a-g",Reasoning 
"How detergents work?
Washing alone with the water can remove some of the dirt but it does not remove the grease stains. This is because water does not wet greasy dirt.
We need detergent which mixes water with dirt to remove it from the clothes.
Detergent molecules look like hairpin shape. When we add detergents to the water one end stick to water and the other end sticks to the dirt.
As a result dirt is getting attracted to the detergent molecules and they get detached from the clothes and they are suspended in the water.
Detergent molecules get attracted to water and when water is removed the dirt also gets removed from the clothes.",Reasoning 
"Angle of Contact
Angle of contact is the angle at which a liquid interface meets a solid surface.
It is denoted by θ.
It is different at interfaces of different pairs of liquids and solids.
For example: - Droplet of water on louts leaf. The droplet of water(Liquid) is in contact with the solid surface which is leaf.
This liquid surface makes some angle with the solid surface.This angle is known as angle of contact.","Definition, Examples, reasoning "
"Significance of Angle of Contact
Angle of contact determines whether a liquid will spread on the surface of a solid or it will form droplets on it. 
If the Angle of contact is obtuse:then droplet will be formed.
If the Angle of contact is acute: then the water will spread.
Case1: When droplet is formed 
Consider we have a solid surface, droplet of water which is liquid and air.
The solid liquid interface denoted by Ssl, solid air interface denoted by Ssaand liquid air interface denoted by Sla.
The angle which Ssl makes with Sla. It is greater than the 900.
Therefore droplet is formed.Case 2: When water just spreads 
The angle which liquid forms with solid surface is less than 900.",Reasoning
"Why water and bubbles are drops?
Whenever liquid is left to itself it tends to acquire the least possible surface area so that it has least surface energy so it has most stability.
Therefore for more stability they acquire the shape of sphere, as sphere has least possible area.",Reasoning
"Distinction between Drop, Cavity and Bubble
Drop: - Drop is a spherical structure filled with water. 
There is only one interface in the drop.
The interface separates water and air.
Example:Water droplet.Water droplets
Cavity: -Cavity is a spherical shape filled with air.
In the surroundings there is water and in middle there is cavity filled with air.
There is only one interface which separates air and water.
Example: - bubble inside the aquarium.
 
Bubble: - In a bubble there are two interfaces.One is air water and another is water and air.
Inside a bubble there is air and there is air outside.
But it consists of thin film of water.
Soap bubbles
 
Pressure inside a drop and a cavity
Pressure inside a drop is greater than the pressure outside.
Suppose there is a spherical drop of water of radius ‘r’ which is in equilibrium.
Consider there is increase in radius which is Δr.
Therefore Extra Surface energy = Surface Tension(S) x area 
= Sla x 4π(r+Δr)2 – Slax4πr2
After calculating
Extra Surface energy=8πr Δr Sla
At Equilibrium, Extra Surface energy = Energy gain due to the pressure difference
8πr Δr Sla = (Pi - Po) 4πr2xΔr
where Pi= Pressure inside the drop and Po = Pressure outside the drop.
                        After calculation Pi - Po = 2 Sla/rPressure inside a Bubble
Pressure inside a bubble is greater than the pressure outside.
As bubble has 2 interfaces, Pi-Po=2Sla/r x 2
Therefore, Pi-Po=4Sla/rConclusion: - In general, for a liquid-gas interface, the convex side has a higher pressure than the concave side.","Property, Definition, Reasoning"
"Capillary Rise
In Latin the word capilla means hair.
Due to the pressure difference across a curved liquid-air interface the water rises up in a narrow tube in spite of gravity.
Consider a vertical capillary tube of circular cross section (radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water.
The contact angle between water and glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in the capillary is concave. As a result there is a pressure difference between the two sides of the top surface. This is given by 
(Pi – Po) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )= (2S/a) cos θ (i)
Thus the pressure of the water inside thetube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)is less than the atmospheric pressure.
Considerthe two points A and B. Theymust be at the same pressure, 
P0 + h ρ g = Pi = PA (ii)
where ρ is the density of water,and h is called the capillary
h ρ g = (Pi – P0) = (2S cos θ )/a (By using equations (i) and (ii))
Therefore the capillary rise is due to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller radius.","Definition, Reasoning "

COLLISION. Collision between the two bodies is defined as mutual interaction of the bodies for a short interval of time due to which the energy and the momentum of the interacting bodies change.,Definition
"Types of Collision. There are basically three types of collisions-  i) Elastic Collision � That is the collision between perfectly elastic bodies. In this type of collision, since only conservative forces are operating between the interacting bodies, both kinetic energy and momentum of the system remains constant. ii) Inelastic Collision � That is the collision between perfectly inelastic or plastic bodies. After collision bodies stick together and move with some common velocity. In this type of collision only momentum is conserved. Kinetic energy is not conserved due to the presence of non-conservative forces between the interacting bodies. iii) Partially Elastic or Partially Inelastic Collision � That is the collision between the partially elastic bodies. In this type of collision bodies do separate from each other after collision but due to the involvement of non-conservative inelastic forces kinetic energy of the system is not conserved and only momentum is conserved. Consider two bodies of masses m1 and m2 with their center of masses moving along the same straight line in same direction with initial velocities u and u2 with m1 after m2. Condition necessary for the collision is u1 > u2 due to which bodies start approaching towards each other with the velocity of approach u2-u1 . Collision starts as soon as the bodies come in contact. Due to its greater velocity and inertia m1continues to push m 2in the forward direction whereas m due to its small velocity and inertia pushes m1 in the backward direction. Due to this pushing force involved between the two colliding bodies they get deformed at the point of contact and a part of their kinetic energy gets consumed in the deformation of the bodies. Also m1 being pushed opposite to the direction of the motion goes on decreasing its velocity and m being pushed in the direction of motion continues increasing its velocity. This process continues until both the bodies acquire the same common velocity v. Up to this stage there is maximum deformation in the bodies maximum part of their kinetic energy gets consumed in their deformation.","Types, Definition"
"Elastic collision. In case of elastic collision bodies are perfectly elastic. Hence after their maximum deformation they have tendency to regain their original shapes, due to which they start pushing each other. Since m2 is being pushed in the direction of motion its velocity goes on increasing and m1 being pushed opposite to the direction of motion its velocity goes on decreasing. Thus condition necessary for separation i.e. v is attained and the bodies get separated with velocity of separation v2 - v1 . In such collision the part of kinetic energy of the bodies which has been consumed in the deformation of the bodies is again returned back to the system when the bodies regain their original shapes. Hence in such collision energy conservation can also be applied along with the momentum conservation. Applying energy conservation.","Definition, Reasoning"

"Inelastic collision. In case of inelastic collision bodies are perfectly inelastic. Hence after their maximum deformation they have no tendency to regain their original shapes, due to which they continue moving with the same common velocity. In such collision the part of kinetic energy of the bodies which has been consumed in the deformation of the bodies is permanently consumed in the deformation of the bodies against non-conservative inelastic forces. Hence in such collision energy conservation can-not be applied and only momentum conservation is applied. Applying momentum conservation","Definition, Reasoning"
Partially Elastic or Partially Inelastic Collision. In this case bodies are partially elastic. Hence after their maximum deformation they have tendency to regain their original shapes but not as much as perfectly elastic bodies. Hence they do separate but their velocity of separation is not as much as in the case of perfectly elastic bodies i.e. their velocity of separation is less than the velocity of approach. In such collision the part of kinetic energy of the bodies which has been consumed in the deformation of the bodies is only slightly returned back to the system. Hence in such collision energy conservation can-not be applied and only momentum conservation is applied. (v2 -v1) < (u1-u2),"Definition, Reasoning"
"Collision In Two Dimension � Oblique Collision. When the centers of mass of two bodies are not along the same straight line, the collision is said to be oblique. In such condition after collision bodies are deflected at some angle with the initial direction. In this type of collision momentum conservation is applied separately along x-axis and y-axis. If the collision is perfectly elastic energy conservation is also applied",Definition
"e = (v2-v1)/(u1-u2). Case-1 For perfectly elastic collision, velocity of separation is equal to velocity of approach, therefore e = 1.

"Work vs. Energy. Work refers to overpowering resistance by the application of force. It is evident that the resistance has been overpowered from the movement of application of force. Energy is the capability to do work or perform some action and can be thought of something that is possessed or stored. It exists in several forms like light, heat, electrical, potential energy or other forms.Work and energy have similar units and are closely related. Energy can be put in storage, but that cannot be done for work.  Work is energy in motion. Energy alters from one form to another by the process of doing work. Usually, there are two sorts of work Positive and negative work. If the direction of the force is in the same direction as the motion of its spot of application, work done is said to be positive.If the course of the force is in the opposite direction to the motion of its point of application, negative work is said to be done.","Property, Reasoning"
"there is some relation between work done and energy. Now we will see the theorem that relates them. According to this theorem the net work done on a body is equal to change in kinetic energy of the body. This is known as Work Energy Theorem. It can be represented as Kf – Ki = W. Where, Kf = Final kinetic energy. Ki = Initial kinetic energy,  W = net work done. So the above equation follows law of conservation of energy according to which we can only transfer energy from one form to another. Also here the work done is the work done by all forces acting on the body like gravity, friction, external force etc.","Definition, Formula"

You might have noticed that you feel hotter on a sunny afternoon as compared to a windy night. This is because of the difference in temperatures. Temperature is very high in the afternoon as compared to night. This chapter basically gives us the

Examples: information about thermal properties of matter where we will study about the properties of different substances by virtue of heat / heat transfer.

In simple terms, we can say that when temperature is more heat is more and when temperature is less heat is less.

Hot Sunny day (Temperature is more)and ice cold water (Temperature is less).

"Measurement of Temperature

Temperature is measured with the help of thermometer. Mercury and Alcohol are commonly used liquids in the liquid-in-glass thermometers.

To construct a thermometer two fixed points are to be chosen as a reference points. These fixed points are known as freezing(ice point) and boiling point(steam point). The water freezes and boils at these two points under standard pressure.
The ice and steam point in Fahrenheit Temperature scale are 32°F and 212 °F resp.It has 180 equal intervals between two reference points.
On Celsius Scale values are 0°C and 100°C for ice and steam point resp. It has 100 equal intervals between two reference points.
(tf -32)/180 = tc/100

Where tf = Fahrenheit temperature

            tc= Celsius temperature

"Ideal-gas Equation and Absolute Temperature

A thermometer that uses any gas, however, gives the same readings regardless of which gas is used because all gases have same expansion at low temperature.

Variables that describe the behaviour of gas are:-

Quantity(mass)
Pressure
Volume
Temperature i.e. (P,V,T) where (T = t + 273.15; t is the temperature in °C)
Gases which have low density obey certain laws: -

1.Boyle’s Law– PV = constant(when temperature T is constant)

2.Charles’ Law- V/T = constant (when pressure P is constant)

 

If combine both the above laws the equation becomes PV = RT where R is called universal gas constant and its value = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1.
PV = RT is the ideal gas equation which is applicable only at low temperature.
For any quantity of dilute gas,
PV=μRT where μ, is the number of moles in the sample of gas.

In a constant volume gas thermometer temperature varies with respect to pressure. Temperature changes linearly with increase in pressure.","Property, Formula, Relation"

Absolute Zero is defined as minimum absolute temperature of an ideal gas.

If we plot pressure versus temperature we get a straight line and if we extend the line backwards to the x-axis as shown in the graph below. The minimum temperature is found to be 273.15 °C (experimentally) and this value is known as absolute zero.

"Thermal Expansion

Thermal expansion is the phenomenon of increase in dimensions of a body due to increase in its temperature.",Definition
"Examples of Thermal Expansion

The water is cold at the top of the lake because it expands and becomes less dense. So when this water freezes it insulates the water below it from the outside which means cold air is like a blanket. It is because of this property many fish can survive in the winter.
As soon as we turn on a hot water tap, the water comes very fast as water is still cold .But as soon as hot water starts coming , the flow of water becomes less and in some cases it stops. This is because the hot water heats the metal valve inside the tap which expands to block off any more flow of water.","Examples, Property"
"Reason why Thermal Expansion happens is:-

When any object is heated particles start moving in random motion and thus average distance between the molecules increases and a result the object appears to be expanded when heated. As we can see the picture below atoms is tightly packed but when we apply heat they will start moving in random motion.","Causes, Property"
"When an object is cooled it contracts which is referred as negative thermal expansion.
",Definition
"Types of Thermal Expansion

Linear Expansion :- The expansion in length
Area Expansion :- The expansion in area
Volume Expansion :- The expansion in volume",Types
"Linear Expansion

 

Linear Expansion means expansion in length due to increase in temperature. Linear expansion means fractional change in length i.e. how the length is changing with respect to original length.",Definition
"As we can see from above images the length has been increased from

l to l+Δl.                                              

Coefficient of Linear Expansion is a parameter which tells us how the size of the object changes with change in temperature. It is defined as degree of linear expansion divided by the change in temperature.

If the solid is in the form of long rod, then for small change in temperature, ΔT, the fractional change in length, Δl/l, is directly proportional to ΔT.
Mathematically can be written as:-
Δl/l=αlΔT
Where αl= the coefficient of linear expansion

It is denoted by αl

"Area Expansion
Area Expansion can be defined as expansion in area due to increase in temperature. In case of area expansion there is increase in both length wise and breadth wise.

As we can see from above images the area of the cube has been increased from A to A + ΔA.

Mathematically can be written as:-

ΔA / A =αa ΔT

Where αa = coefficient of area expansion.

Coefficient of Area Expansion is defined as degree of area expansion divided by the change in temperature. This means there is increase in area of an object with the change in temperature.

It is denoted by αa
It is characteristic of the substance and it varies with temperature.
","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Volume Expansion
It can be defined as expansion in volume due to increase in temperature. This means there is increase in length, breadth and height of a substance.

The expansion in volume due to increase in temperature. Mathematicallycan be written as:-
ΔV / V =αv ΔT

Where αv = coefficient of volume.

Coefficient of Volume can be defined as degree of volume expansion divided by change in temperature.

It is denoted by αv.
It is characteristic of the substance
It varies with temperature.
If graph is plotted between αv and temperature,then initially αv is a changing linearly then it varies non-linearly and at higher temperatures and then it becomes constant.

"Anomalous Behaviour of Water

Water shows some exceptional behaviour that is when it is heated at 0°C, it contracts instead of expanding and it happens till it reaches 4 °C. The volume of a given amount of water is minimumat 4 °C therefore its density is maximum(Refer the Fig). After 4 °C water starts expanding. Below 4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore the density decreases. This means water has maximum density at 4 °C.
Advantages of Anomalous behaviour of Water
Because of this property of water in lakes and ponds freeze only at the top layer and at the bottom it does not, butif the water freezes at the bottom also then animal and plant life would not be possible.",Property
"Relation between αv and αl

Relation between coefficient of linear expansion and coefficient of volume expansion =


To derive the above relation consider a block of cube initially its length is l ,suppose temperature is increased T + ΔT as a result length will also increase from (l+Δl)

Then αl= (Δl/l)/ ΔT

Therefore,αllΔT = Δl

Also as the temperature increases by ΔT the volume also increases V +ΔV

Where ΔV = change in volume which we can write as

ΔV = (l+Δl)3 – l3

By solving we get ΔV= 3l2Δl(we are neglecting (Δl)2 and (Δl)3as they are very small as to compared to l.

Therefore, Δ V = (3V Δl)/l

                        =3VαlΔT

Which gives αv = 3αl the relation between coefficient of volume expansion and coefficient of linear expansion.

Thermal stress:

Mechanical stress induced by a body when some or all of its parts are not free to expand or contract in response to change in temperature.
When an object is heated or cooled either it expands or it contracts but if for some reason if the object is not allowed to expand to contract under that case mechanical stress is induced in the body which is known as Thermal Stress.

While designing structures like concrete highways gaps are left which are filled by some flexible material so that concrete is allowed to expand or contract.","Definition, Formula, Relation, Property, Reasoning, Examples"

"Specific heat capacity:

Every substance has a unique value for the amount of heat absorbed or rejected to change the temperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This quantity is referred to as the specific heat capacity of the substance.
 

Mathematically can be written as:-

"Specific Heat Capacity

Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat per unit mass absorbed or rejected by the substance to change its temperature by one.

It depends on the nature of the substance and its temperature.
The SI unit of specific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.
 

Molar specific heat capacity: -

Heat capacity per mole of the substance is the defined as the amount of heat (in moles) absorbed or rejected(instead of mass m in kg) by the substance to change its temperature by one unit.
Mathematically can be written as:-

C = S/ μ= ΔQ / μ ΔT

Where

μ= amount of substance in moles
C = molar specific heat capacity of the substance.

"Regelation:- 

Regelation can be defined as phenomenon in which the freezing point of water is lowered by the application of pressure.
Example:- Girl skating on snow","Definition, Examples"
"Cause of regelation:-

If we have a block of ice and a copper wire pulled by two masses if we will observe that copper wire can pass through ice block this is because copper is good conductor of heat so as it passes through the ice it gets refreeze as the copper will generate heat and this heat will pass quickly to the ice below and it starts melting because there is increase in pressure which lowers temperature as a result the wire will move through the ice. This happens because of regelation.","Causes, Effects, Property"
"Vaporisation: - Transition from liquid to vapour.

The change of state from liquid to vapour (or gas) is called vaporisation.
 

The temperature at which the liquid and the vapour states of the substance coexist is called its boiling point.
Boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure is known as normal boiling point.
It depends on nature of substance & pressure
It increases with increase in pressure and vice versa.
Example: As altitude increases, the density of the air becomes thinner, and thus exerts less pressure. At high altitudes, external pressure on water is therefore decreased and will hence take less energy to break the water. If less energy is required it means less heat and less temperature which means that water will boil at a lower temperature.","Definition, Property, Examples, Relation"

Cp-Cυ = R
Here Cp and Cυ are molar specific heats under constant pressure and constant volume condition respectively.
The specific heat capacity of a gas at constant pressure is greater than the specific heat capacity of the gas at constant volume i.e. Cp > Cυ. Reason is that when heat supplied to a gas at constant volume, no work would be done by the gas against the external pressure and all the energy is used to raise the temperature of the gas. On the other hand when the heat is supplied to the gas at constant pressure, its volume increases and the heat energy supplied to it is used to increase the temperature of the gas as well as in doing the work against the external pressure.
The difference, between the two specific heats is the thermal equivalent of the work done in expanding the gas against the external pressure.","Relation, Property, Reasoning, Property"

What is Kinetic Theory?

Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving atoms or molecules.
In solids the molecules are very tightly packed as inter molecular space is not present In liquids inter molecular spaces are more as compared to solids and in gases the molecules are very loosely packed as intermolecular spaces are very large.
The random movement of molecules in a gas is explained by kinetic theory of gases.
We will also see that why kinetic theory is accepted as a success theory.

John Dalton

Atomic hypothesis was given by many scientists. According to which everything in this universe is made up of atoms.
Atoms are little particles that move around in a perpetual order attracting each other when they are little distance apart.
But if they are forced very close to each other then they rebel.
For example: - Consider a block of gold. It consists of molecules which are constantly moving.
Dalton’s atomic theory is also referred as the molecular theory of matter.This theory proves that matter is made up of molecules which in turn are made up of atoms.
According to Gay Lussac’s law when gases combine chemically to yield another gas,their volumes are in ratios of small integers.
Avogadro’s law states that the equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules.
Conclusion: - All these laws proved the molecular nature of gases.
Dalton’s molecular theory forms the basis of Kinetic theory.","Definition, Examples, Property, Reasoning"

"Behaviour of Gases

Gases at low pressures and high temperatures much above that at which they liquify (or solidify) approximately satisfy a relation between their pressure, temperature and volume:
PV=KT (i)
This is the universal relation which is satisfied by all gases.
where P, V, T are pressure,volume and temperature resp. and
K is the constant for a given volume of gas. It varies with volume of gas.
K=NkB where
N=number of molecules and
kB = Boltzmann Constant and its value never change.
From equation (i) PV= NkB
Therefore PV/NT = constant=(kB)(Same for all gases).
Consider there are 2 gases :- (P1,V1,T1) and (P2, V2,T2) where P, V and T are pressure, volume and temperature resp.
Therefore P1,V1/(N1T1) = P2V2/(N2T2)
Conclusion: - This relation is satisfied by all gases at low pressure and high temperature.","Property, Relation, Formula"
"Justification of the Avogadro’s hypothesis from equation of gas

Avogadro’s hypothesis states that equal volumes of all gases at equal temperature and pressure have the same number of molecules.
Consider the equation PV/NT = constant and if P,V and T are same for 2 gases then N(number of molecules) is also same.
According to Avogadro’s hypothesis number of molecules per unit volume is same for all gasesat a fixed P and T.
Avogadro number is denoted by NA. WhereA denotes Avogadro number.
NA = 6.02x1023. It is universal value.

WhereP,V are pressure, volume, T =absolute temperature,μ = number of moles and R =universal gas constant.
R= kBNA where kB = Boltzmann constant and NA = Avogadro’s Number
This equation tells about the behaviour of gas at a particular situation.

Where μ (no. of moles) = N/NA where N=no of molecules and NA = Avogadro number(no of molecules in 1 mole of gas).Orμ = M/Mowhere M=mass of sample of gas and Mo = molar mass.
PV = (N/NA)RT(putting μ=N/NA in equation(i))
By simplifying PV = NkBT
PV=NkBT => P = (N/V) kBT => P=nkBT where n(number density) =N/V where N=number of molecules and V=volume.
Therefore we get PV=nkBT
Substitute μ = M/Mo in equation(i)
PV=(M/Mo) RT => P=(M/V)1/MoRT where
ρ(mass density of the gas) = M/V
Therefore P=ρRT/Mo","Reasoning, Formula, Relation"

This means it has constant value at all temperature and all pressure.
But in case of real gases graph approach ideal gas behaviour at high temperature and low pressure.
At high temperature and low pressure molecules are far apart. When temperature is increased the molecules will move randomly far from each other.
As a result molecular interaction decreases the gas behaves as an ideal gas.
The ideal behaviour comes into picture when the molecular present inside the gas don’t interact with each other.

"Deducing Dalton’s Law of partial pressures

Dalton’s law of partial pressure states that the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of partial pressures.
Consider if there are several ideal gases mixed together in a vessel,then the total pressure of that vessel is equal to sum of partial pressure.
Partial pressure is the pressure exerted by a particular gas if only that gas is present in the vessel.
For example: -
Consider if in a vessel there is a mixture of 3 gases, A,B and C.So the partial pressure of A is equal to pressure exerted only by Aand considering B and C are not present.
Similarly partial pressure of B is equal to the pressure exerted only by B and considering A and C are not there.
Similarly for C.
According to Dalton’s law the total pressure of mixture is sum of partial pressure of A, partial pressure of B and partial pressure of C","Definition, Reasoning"
"To show how perfect gas equation concludes Dalton’s law of partial pressure:-

Suppose there is a mixture of ideal gases which means these gases do not interact with each other.
By perfect gas equation PV=μRT
Where V=volume of vessel,P=Pressure and T=temperature andμ (no. of moles).
As there are mixture of gases therefore μ=μ1+μ2+ ---- so on.
PV=( μ1+μ2)RT
P=( μ1+μ2)RT/V =>μ1RT/V + μ2RT/V + ---
P=P1+P2 +----
Where P1=partial pressure of gas 1 and P2=partial pressure of gas 2.
Therefore P= P1+P2+---total pressure due to the mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressure of the gas.","Reasoning, Formula, Relation"

"What does Kinetic Theory tells?

At ordinary temperature and pressure the molecular size is very small as compared to inter molecular distance between them.
In case of gas, molecules are very far from each other and the size of molecules is small as compared to the distance between them.
As a result, interaction between them is negligible. As there is no interaction between the molecules, there will be no force between the molecules.
As a result molecules are moving freely as per newton’s first law of motion.
The molecules should move along straight line but when they come closer they experience the intermolecular forces and as a result their velocities change.
This phenomenon is known as collision.These collisions are elastic.
","Property, Reasoning, Property, Effects"
"Justifying the assumptions:-

We have assumed the container containing the gas is a cube. The shape of the container is immaterial.
For a vessel of any arbitrary shape, we can choose a small infinitesimal (planar) area and can prove the above derivation.
We will see A and Δt are not there in the final result.
By Pascal’s law pressure in one portion of gas in equilibrium is the same as anywhere else.
All collisions are neglected.
The number of molecules hitting the wall in time Δt was found to be ½ n AvxΔt, with random collisionsand asteady state of gas.
Thus, if a molecule with velocity (vx, vy,vz)acquires a different velocity due to collision withsome molecules, there will always be some othermolecule with a different initial velocity whichafter a collision acquires the velocity (vx, vy, vz).
Molecular collision, when they are not too frequent and the time spent in collision is very small compared to the time between collisions, will not have any affect in the above calculation.","Effects, Reasoning"
"Law of Equipartition of energy:Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of Freedom can be defined as independent displacements or rotations that specify the orientation of a body or system.
A molecule free to move in space needs three coordinates to specify its location.
If it is constrained to move in a plane it needs to.
If constrained to move along a line, it needs just one coordinate to locate it.
For example:-Consider a room and if we tie a thick rope from one wall to another.
Take a ball which is moving straight on the rope.
The ball has only 1 degree of freedom. It can move only in one particular dimension.
Consider if the ball is on the floor which is two-dimensional, then the ball can move along 2 directions.
The ball has 2 degree of freedoms.
Consider if we throw the ball in space which is 3 dimensional. Then the ball can move in 3 dimensions.

The 2 oxygen atoms along with the bond are considered as whole body.
When the body as a whole is moving from one point to another is known as translational.
Consider a molecule which is free to move in space and so it will need 3 coordinates(x, y, z) to specify its location.
Therefore it has 3 degrees of freedom.
Similarly a molecule which is free to move in a plane which is 2 dimensional and so it needs 2 coordinates to specify its location.
Therefore it has 2 degrees of freedom.
Similarly a molecule which is free to move in line it needs 1 coordinate to specify its location.
Therefore it has 1 degree of freedom.

"Introduction

In this chapter we will learn about oscillatory motion or oscillations. Any motion which repeats itself at regular intervals of time is known as periodic motion. If a body moves back and forth repeatedly about its mean position then it is said to be in oscillatory motion.

For example: The to and fro movement of pendulum, jumping on a trampoline, a child swinging on a swing.

Oscillations can be defined as Periodic to and fro motion which repeat itself at regular intervals of time.","Definition, Examples"
"Periodic and Oscillatory motions

Oscillations are defined as to and fro motion which repeat itself after regular intervals of time.In oscillations, the frequency of vibrations is comparatively less. 

For example: The to and fro motion of a pendulum clock","Definition, Examples, Property"
"Vibrations are defined as movement of object about its mean position and this motion can be linear, circular, periodic or non-periodic. If vibrations frequency is more and external force also acts on a body.

For eg: - Vibration of guitar string.When we move our fingers on the strings of guitar the strings vibrate so rapidly we can’t make it out when it comes to its mean position and when it goes to extreme position because the frequency is very high as a result it has vibratory motion.

","Definition, Examples, Property"
"Oscillatory motion and Periodic Motion

Every oscillatory motion is periodic motion that is every oscillatory motion repeats itself after the fixed interval of time. But every periodic motion is not oscillatory.For e.g.:- Motion of planets around the sun is periodic but is not oscillatory motion.","Property, Examples"
"Equilibrium Position

Oscillating bodies comes to rest at their equilibrium positions. When a bob is suspended from a rigid support it goes to extreme positions and then comes to its mean position which is also known as equilibrium position.
Equilibrium Position is that position where an object tends to come at rest when no external force is applied.

"Displacement

Displacement in periodic motion can be represented by a function which is periodic which repeats after fixed interval of time.
In the above image we can see that motion of an oscillating simple pendulum canbe described in terms of angular displacement θ from the vertical.
In the above image we can see that there is a block whose one end is attached to a spring and another is attached to a rigid wall.x is the displacement from the wall.

In the above figure a blockis attached to a spring, the other end of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The block moves on a frictionless surface. The motion of the block can be described in terms of its distance or displacement x from the wall.

f (t) = A cos ωt

As cosine function repeats after 2π so it can be written as

cos (θ) = cos (ωt + 2π)            Equation (1)

cos (ωt) = cos (ωt + 2π) (it keep on repeating after 2π)

 

Let Time Period = T

f (T) = f(t+T) where displacement keeps on repeating after (t+T)

Acos (ωt) = cosω(t+T) = Acos (ωt+ wT)

Acosωt = A cos (ωt+ωT)          Equation (2)

From Equation (1) and Equation (2)

ωT= 2π

Or T=2π /ω

"SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a periodic motion the body moves to and fro about its mean position.The restoring force on the oscillating body is directly proportional to its displacement and is always directed towards its mean position.

In the above image we can see that a particle is vibrating to and fro within the limits –A and +A.

The oscillatory motion is said to be SHM if the displacement x of the particle from origin varies with time t:

x (t) = A cos (ωt + Φ)

Where

x (t) : displacement x as a function of time

A= amplitude

It is defined as magnitude of maximum displacement of the particle from its mean position.
ωt +Φ = phase angle (time-dependent)

ω= angular frequency

Φ = phase constant

SHM is a periodic motion in which displacement is a sinusoidal function of time.
If we plot the graph between displacement versus time we can conclude that the displacement is continuous function of time.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Phase

It is that quantity that determines the state of motion of the particle.

Its value is (ωt + Φ)
It is dependent on time.
Value of phase at time t=0, is termed as Phase Constant. When the motion of the particle starts it goes to one of the extreme position at that time phase is considered as 0.

Let x (t) = A cos (ωt) where we are taking (Φ = 0)

Mean Position (t= 0)
x (0) = A cos (0) = A (cos0=1)
t=T/4, t= T/2, t=3T/4, t=T and t=5T/4","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Angular Frequency (ω)

Angular frequency refers to the angular displacement per unit time. It can also be defined as the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g., in oscillations and waves). Angular frequency is larger than frequency ν (in cycles per second, also called Hz), by a factor of 2π.

Consider the oscillatory motion which is varying with time t and displacement x of the particle from the origin:

x (t) = cos (ωt + Φ)

Let Φ = 0

x (t) = cos (ωt)

After t=T i.e. x (t) = x (t+T)

A cos ωt = A cos ω (t + T)

Now the cosine function is periodic with period 2π, i.e., it first repeats itself after 2π. Therefore,

ω (t + T) = ωt + 2π

i.e. ω = 2π/ T

Where ω = angular frequency of SHM.

I. unit is radians per second.
It is 2π times the frequency of oscillation.
Two simple harmonic motions may have the same A and φ, but different ω.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"SHM & Uniform Circular Motion

Uniform Circular motion can be interpreted as a SHM.

To explain above statement:- Consider a ball tied to a thread and moving in a circular path such a way it appears to be in circular motion for a person who is observing it from top view or who is standing in the same plane as we are. But it appears to be SHM if somebody is standing in the same plane of motion.
Case 1: It is executing circular motion.



Case 2: Circular motion observed by a person when standing on the same plane.

 

Case 3: It is appears to be SHM for a person who is standing in the same line of sight.

Mathematically:-

Consider any particle moving in a circular path whose radius is R

Angular velocity = w

Angular position =∫θ dt

                       =wt + φ

Consider the projection of particle on x-axis be P’.

Displacement = Acosθ

                       x=A cos(wt+ φ)

the above equation same as the equation of simple harmonic motion

 

As the particle is moving in the same way the projections are also moving.

When the particle is moving in the upper part of circle then the projections start moving towards left.
When the particle is moving in the lower part of the circle then the projections are moving towards right.
We can conclude that the particle is swinging from left to right and again from right to left.
This to and fro motion is SHM.

Conclusion: -

SHM is the projection of uniform circular motion on the diameter of the circle in which the SHM takes place.

","Definition, Reasoning, Property"
"Velocity in Simple Harmonic Motion

Uniform Circular motion can be defined as motion of an object in a circle at a constant speed.
Consider a particle moving in circular path
The velocity at any point P at any time t will be tangential to the point P.
Consider θ = ωt+ φ where
θ = angular position
ω = angular velocity of the particle
To calculate the value of velocity along the x-axis for theprojectionP’which is executing SHM.
To find the component of velocity along -ive x-axis, we can write = -v cos(900 - θ)
This is can be written as:

= -v cos [900 – (ωt + φ)]
v (t) = - v sin(ωt+ φ) (Equation 1)
where

v (t) is instantaneous velocity of the particle executing the SHM.
(-ive sign tells that the velocity is directed towards negative x-axis)
To verify whether the Equation(1)is same if we calculate directly from SHM:-
x(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)

where

x(t) = displacement vector
v (t) = dx/dt

where

v(t) = velocity
dx/dt is rate of change of displacement
= -Awsin (wt + φ)

v (t) =  - A w sin(wt + φ)  (Same as Equation(1))

We can see from the above equation that the radius of the circular motionbecomes the amplitude of the SHM.
Instantaneous velocity of the particle executing SHM is given as:-  v (t) = - A w sin(wt + φ)","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Acceleration in Simple Harmonic Motion

Acceleration in uniform circular motion always directed towards the centre. It is known as radial acceleration.
ap = -ω2r where r = radius
Consider a particle moving in a circular path. Particle is at some point P at some instant of time, radius of circular path is equal to amplitude.
Acceleration will be given as
ap = -ω2Awhere

A = radius of the circle
(-ive sign shows it is pointing towards the centre of the circle.)
Consider the acceleration of the projection of the particle P’ on the x-axis.
Accelerationwill be given as
a(t) = -ap cosθ
a(t) = - ap cos(ωt + φ)
=ω2A cos (ωt + φ)
a(t) = - ω2x(t) (Using x(t)= A cos (ωt + φ))
 To verify expression for acceleration when calculated directly from SHM -

Displacement in SHM is = A cos (ωt + φ)
Velocity v(t) in SHM is = -Aw sin (ωt + φ)
Therefore,

a(t) = dv/dt
= - ω2A cos (ωt + φ)
a(t) = - ω2x(t) (Using x(t)= A cos (ωt + φ))
Equation of acceleration of the particle which executesSHM:-

a(t) = - ω2x(t)  

We can conclude that:-

a is proportional to displacement
acceleration is always directed towards the centre(in circular motion centre is mean position of the SHM)
From above we can say that

SHM is the projection of the uniform circular motion such that centre of uniform circular motion becomes the mean position of the SHM and the radius of the circular motion is the amplitude of the SHM.
In the above figure we can see that the acceleration, a(t), of the particle P′ is the projection of the acceleration a of the reference particle P.

In all the below graphs displacement, velocity and acceleration all have the same time period T, but they differ in phase.

The acceleration is maximum where velocity is minimum and vice-versa.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Energy in SHM

The Kinetic and Potential energies in a SHM varies between 0 and their maximum values.
Kinetic energy, potential energy and the total energy is a function of time in the above graph. BothKinetic energy and potential energy repeats after time T/2.
Kinetic energy, potential energy and the total energy is a function of displacement in the above graph.

The kinetic energy (K) of a particle executing SHM can be defined as

K= ½ mv2

= ½ mω2A2sin2 (ωt + φ)

K=½ k A2 sin2 (ωt + φ)

The above expression is a periodic function of time, being zero when the displacement is maximum and maximum when the particle is at the mean position.
The potential energy (U) of a particleexecuting simple harmonic motion is,

U(x) = ½ kx2

U= ½ k A2 cos2 (ωt + φ)

The potential energy of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is alsoperiodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean position and maximum at the extremedisplacements.
Total energy of the system always remains the same

E = U + K

= ½ k A2 sin2 (ωt + φ) + ½ k A2 cos2 (ωt + φ)

E=½ k A2(sin2 (ωt + φ) + cos2 (ωt + φ))

 

The above expression can be written as

E = ½ k A2

Total energy is always constant.

"In this chapter we will see the importance of waves in our life.

We will also study about the different properties of waves, some terms related to waves and also about different types of waves.We will also learn how waves propagate.

For example: -

Medium required by the waves to travel from one point to another:-
Consider a boy holding a thread and one end of thread is tied to the wall.
When a boy moves the thread, the thread moves in the form of a wave.
Similarly a boat sailing over the sea,the boat is able to move because of waves.
The ripples formed in a lake when we drop a stone in the lake.They are also waves.
Earthquakes are caused due to the waves under the surface of the earth.
The strings of the guitar when we play them are also waves again.
Music system which we use to hear songs.This is due to sound waves.
When 2 people talk they are able to hear each other because of the sound waves.

Medium not required by some type of waves to move from one point to another:-
TV remote waves play important part.
Satelliteshelp ustouseTV, mobile phones, music system, the sun, the traffic lights, microwave,x-rays.

Some type of waves can propagate from one point to another without any medium.

Waves which are related to matter:-
There are some set of waves which are inside the matter.
For example: - whole of universe.","Property, Examples"
"What is a wave?

A wave is s disturbance that propagates through space and time,usually with transference of energy.

For example: -

Consider the sound of the horn; this sound reaches our ear because of sound waves.
There is transfer of energy from one point to another with the help of particles in the medium.
These particles don’t move they just move around their mean position,but the energy is getting transferred from one particle to another and it keeps on transferring till it reaches the destination.
The movement of a particle is initiated by the disturbance.And this disturbance is transferred from one point to another through space and time.
Note:-Energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to another.

When a source of energy causes vibration to travel through the medium a wave is created.
","Definition, Property, Causes"
"Types of Waves

Mechanical waves
Electromagnetic waves
Matter waves
",Types
"Mechanical waves: -

The mechanical waves are governed by all the Newton’s laws of motion.
Medium is needed for propagation of the wave.
For Example: - Water Waves, Sound Waves

Water waves: They are mechanical waves for which a medium is required to propagate.
Sound waves: A guitar or music system. Sound waves need a medium to propagate.They cannot travel in vacuum.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Electromagnetic waves:-

Electromagnetic waves are related to electric and magnetic fields.
An electromagnetic wave, does not need a medium to propagate, it carries no mass,does carry energy.
Examples: - Satellite system, mobile phones,radio, music player, x-rays and microwave.

","Definition, Property, Examples, Relation"
"Matter waves:-

Waves related to matter. Matter consists of small particles.
Matter waves are associated with moving electrons,protons,neutrons & other fundamental particlesetc.
It is an abstract concept.
Examples: - pencil, sun, moon, earth, ball, atoms.","Definition, Property, Examples, Relation"
"Transverse Waves

The transverse waves are those in which direction of disturbance or displacement in the medium is perpendicular to that of the propagation of wave.
The direction in which a wave propagates is perpendicular to the direction of disturbance.


For example:-

Consider a manholding one end of a thread and other end of the threadis fixed to wall.
When a little jerk is given to the thread in the upward direction.The entire thread moves in a wavy manner.
The jerk propagated along the entire length of the thread.
The small disturbance which came from the source at one end, that disturbance getting propagatedand that is known as direction of propagation.
Disturbance is vertically upward and wave is horizontal.They are perpendicular to each other.
This type of wave is known as transverse wave.
 

A single pulse is sent along a stretched string. A typical element of the string (suchas that marked with a dot) moves up and then down as the pulse passes through.

The element’s motion is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"How are transverse waves caused?

When we pull a thread in upward direction the formation and propagation of the waves are possible because entire thread is under tension.
This tension is the small disturbance which is given at one end and it gets transferred to its neighbouring molecules.
This will keep on continuing.So this small pulse will get propagated along the length of the thread.
The movement of the particles is perpendicular to the propagation of the wave and the wave will propagate horizontally.
 

It is a transverse wave.

A sinusoidal wave is sent along the string.A typical element of the string moves up and down continuously as the wave passes.
Conclusion: -

Transverse waves are those waves which propagates perpendicular to the direction of the disturbance.
Direction of disturbance is the direction of motion of particles of the medium.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Causes"
"Longitudinal Waves

Longitudinal means something related to length.
In longitudinal waves direction of disturbance or displacement in the medium is along the propagation of the wave.


For example: - Sound waves. Particles and wave moving along the horizontal direction. So both are in the same direction.
In a Longitudinal wave there are regions where particles are very close to each other.These regions are known as compressions.
In some regions the particles are far apart.Those regions are known as rarefactions.","Definition, Property, Examples"
"Displacement in a progressive wave

Amplitude and phase together describe the complete displacement of the wave.
Displacement function is a periodic in space and time.
Displacement of the particles in a medium takes place along the y-axis.
Generally displacement is denoted as a function of X and T, but here it is denoted by y.
In case of transverse wave displacement is given as:
y(x,t) where x=propagation of the wave along x-axis, and particles oscillates along y-axis.
Therefore y(x,t)= A sin(kx – ωt + φ).This is the expression for displacement.
This expression is same as displacement equation which is used in oscillatory motion.
As cosine function;y(x,t)= B cos(kx – ωt + φ),As both sine and cosine function)y (x, t) = A sin (kx – ωt + φ) + B cos(kx – ωt + φ)
Mathematically:

Wave travelling along +X-axis: y(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ).
Consider y=asin(kx – ωt + φ)=> y/a=sin(kx – ωt + φ)
sin-1(y/a) = kx-ωt =>kx=sin-1(y/a) +ωt
x=(1/k)sin-1(y/a)+ (ωt/k)
Wave travelling along –X-axis: x=(1/k)sin-1(y/a)-(ωt/k)(only change in the sign ofωt)
Conclusion:-
As time t increases the value of x increases. This implies the x moves along x-axis.
As time t decreases the value of x decrease. This implies the x moves along (-)ive x-axis.","Property, Formula, Relation"
"Amplitude and Phase of a wave

Amplitude and phase together describes the position of the particle.
Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the elements of the medium from their equilibrium positions as wave passes through them.
It is denoted by A.
In case of transverse wave ,

The distance between the point P and Q (in the Figure) is maximum displacement. This maximum displacement of the particles is known as amplitude.

In case of longitudinal wave,

There are regions of compressions (particles are closely packed) and rarefactions (particles are far apart).
In compressions density of the wave medium is highest and in rarefactions density of the wave is lowest.
Consider when the particle is at rarefaction, in that region as particle gets more space as a result the particles oscillates to the maximum displacement.
Whereas in compressed region the particles oscillates very less as the space is not very much.
The peak or the maximum amplitude is the centre of two compressed regions.Because at the centre of the two compressed region the particle is most free to displace to maximum displaced position.
Conclusion:-

In case of longitudinal wave the particles will not oscillate to a very large distance. This displacement won’t represent the amplitude as it is not maximum possible displacement.
Amplitude is represented basically by the centre of the rarefaction region where the particle is most free to oscillate to its maximum displacement.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"Phase

Phase of a wave describes the state of motion as the wave sweeps through an element at a particular position.

",Definition
In-phase– Two points are said to be in-phase with each other when these two points are at the same position and they both are doing the same thing i.e. both the two points are exhibiting the same behaviour.,Definition
"Out-of-phase –

Two points are said to be out of phase even though they are at the same points but they are doing opposite thing i.e. both the points are exhibiting the different behaviour.
Out of phase means which is not in phase.",Definition
"Expression of Phase

a= amplitude, (kx – ωt + φ)=phase
k=wavenumber,
x=displacement of wave along x-direction,
ω=angular frequency
t=time
φ=Initial phase angle.

Initial Phase angle

Initial phase angle is defined as phase under initial conditions(t=0).
Denoted by φ.
It determines the angle between the starting position and the original.
Consider the figure (1) the starting point is 0.i.e.φ=0.
In figure (2) as it is not starting from 0, therefore φ=π/2.
Similarly in figure (3) φ=π.
So the initial phase angle determines from where the observation starts.
Taking φ=0 does not affect any nature or properties of the wave.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Wavelength 

The term wavelength means length of the wave.
Wavelength is defined as the minimum distance between two consecutive points in the same phase of wave motion.
It is denoted by λ.
In case of transverse wave we use the term crest for the peak of the maximum displacement.
The point of minimum displacement is known as trough.
In case of transverse wave wavelength is the distance between two consecutive crests or distance between two consecutive troughs.
In case of longitudinal wave wavelength is the distance between the two compressions or the distance between the two rarefactions provided the compressions or rarefactions are nearest.","Definition, Property"
"Wave Number

Wave number describes the number of wavelengths per unit distance.

Denoted by ‘k’.

y(x,t)= a sin(kx – ωt + φ) assuming φ=0.

At initial time t=0:-
y(x,0)=asin kx (i)
When x=x+λ then y(x+λ,0)=a sink(x+λ)   (ii)
When x=x+2λ then y(x+2λ,0)=a sink(x+2λ)
Value of y is equal at all points because all the points’ λ, 2λ are in phase with each other. Therefore,

From(i) and (ii) asin kx= a sink(x+λ)  =asin(kx+k λ)

This is true if and only if: -k λ =2 πn, where n=1, 2, 3…

k=(2 π n)/ λ. This is the expression for wave number.

k is also known as propagation constantbecause it tells about the propagationof the wave.

The term angular frequency is used only when there is an angle involved in the motion in that particular motion.

"Travelling Waves

Travelling waves are those waves which travel from one medium to another.
They are also known as progressive wave. Because they progress from one point to another.
Both longitudinal and transverse waves can be travelling wave.
Wave as a whole moves along one direction.","Definition, Property"
"The speed of a travelling wave

To determine the speed of a travelling wave.
The propagation of the wave always takes place along the +(ive) x-axis.
It is denoted by v.
Consider transverse wave moving along (+) ive x axis.
Displacement equation y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt) assuming φ=0.
In case of transverse wave the y denotes the movement of particles along y-axis.x denotes the direction of wave propagation in terms of x axis.
y-axis denotes the displacement of the particles of the medium in case of transverse wave and in case of longitudinal wavex denotes the movement of the particles along x-axis.
In case of longitudinal wave the motion of particles takes place along x-axis and not along y-axis.
The form of equation remains the same for both transverse and longitudinal wave.
Only the direction of propagation i.e. the direction of the movement of the particles differs in case of transverse and longitudinal waves.
We have considered only the motion along the horizontal direction i.e. x-axis. i.e. motion of all the peaks and which is a motion of a straight line.
Displacement takes place along the straight line along x-axis.
y component does not play much role as it talks about the movement of particles of the medium.
When we are considering the peaks as a result phase does not have any role. That is phase is constant.
y/a=sin(kx – ωt) => sin-1 (y/a) = (kx- ωt )
=> x=(1/k)sin-1 (y/a) +ωt/k (where (1/k)sin-1 (y/a)  is constant)
=> Speed V=dx/dt =ω/k
(By differentiating with time,(1/k)sin-1 (y/a) = 0 as differentiating a constant term is 0.) 

Therefore Wave Speed V= ω/kwhereω=angular frequency and k=wave number.","Property, Reasoning, Formula, Relation"
"Different Expressions for Wave Speed

Wave speed V= ω/k. By definition of ω= (2 π)/T where T is period of the wave.
Also k=(2 π)/λ .Therefore v=(2 π)/(T)/(2 π)/(λ) =λ/T
v= λv
As wavelength of a wave increases as a result frequency of the wave decreases as a result speed of wave is constant.
Wave speed is determined by the properties of the medium","Formula, Relation, Property"
"Speed of a transverse wave in a stretched string

Consider a stretched string and if given transverse disturbance on one end then the disturbance travels throughout the string.
Thereby giving rise to transverse waves. 
The particles move up and down and the waves travel perpendicular to the oscillation of the particles.
Transverse wave speed determined by:
Mass per unit length- As mass gives rise to Kinetic energy.If no mass then no kinetic energy.Then there will be no velocity.
It is denoted by μ.
Tension-Tension is the key factor which makes the disturbance propagates along the string.
Because of tension the disturbance travels throughout the wave.
It is denoted by T.","Definition, Property, Effects, Causes"
"Dimensional Analysis to show how the speed is related to mass per unit length and Tension

Therefore μ/T = 1/v2
v=C√T/ μ where C=dimensionless constant
Conclusion: v depends on properties of the medium and not on frequency of the wave.","Formula, Relation, Property"
"Speed of a longitudinal wave in a stretched string

Longitudinal wave speed determined by:

Density – Longitudinal wave is formed due to compressions (particles very close to each other) and rarefactions (particles are far from each other).
At certain places it is very dense and at certain places it is very less dense.So density plays a very important role.
It is denoted by ρ.
Bulk modulus– Bulk modulus tells how does the volume of a medium changes when the pressure on it changes.
If we change the pressure of compressions orrarefactions then the volume of the medium changes.

v= C √ (B/ ρ) where C=dimensionless constant
In case of fluids :- v= C √ (B/ ρ)
In case of solids :- v= C √ (Y/ ρ)","Formula, Relation"
"The principle of superposition of waves

Principle of superposition of waves describes how the individual waveforms can be algebraically added to determine the net waveform.
Waveform tells about the overall motion of the wave.It does not tell about individual particles of the wave.
Suppose we have 2 waves and
Example of superposition of waves is Reflection of waves.
Mathematically: -
Case1:-

Consider 2waves which are in phase with each other. They have the same amplitude, same angular frequency, and same angular wave number.
If wave 1 is represented by y1(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
Wave 2 is also represented by y2(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
By the principle of superposition the resultant wave (2a sin (kx – ωt)) will also be in phase with both the individual waves but the amplitude of the resultant wave will be more.




Case2:-

Consider when the two waves are completely out of phase.i.e. φ = π
If wave 1 is represented by y1(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
Wave 2 is represented by y2(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt+ π).
=>y2=asin(π-(-kx+ ωt) =>y2=-a sin(kx- ωt)
Therefore by superposition principle y=y1+y2=0
 



Case 3:-

Consider when the two waves partially out of phase φ>0 ; φ<π
If wave 1 is represented by y1(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt).
Wave 2 is represented by y2(x, t) =a sin (kx – ωt+ φ).
Therefore by the principle of superposition of waves ,y = y1+ y2
=a[sin(kx-ωt)+sin(kx – ωt+ φ]
y=2a cos (φ/2) sin (kx – ωt + (φ/2))
( By using the formula sinA +sinB=2sin(A+B)/2) cos(A-B)/2)
Amplitude = 2a cos (φ/2) and Phase will be determined by (φ/2).","Definition, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
"Reflection of waves

Reflection of waves is the change in the direction of a wave upon striking the interface between two materials.

When a wave strikes any interface between any two mediums the bouncing back of wave is termed as reflection of waves.

Interface can be categorised into 2 types:

Open boundary: - When a wave strikes an interface in case of open boundary it will get reflected as well as refracted.
Closed boundary or a rigid boundary: - When a wave is incident on an interface it will completely get reflected. Example:-Wave striking wall(echo)
Reflection at rigid boundary

Consider a string which is fixed to the wall at one end. When an incident wave hits a wall,it will exerta force on the wall.
By Newton’s third law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force of equal magnitude on the string.
Since the wall is rigid wall won’t move, therefore no wave is generated at the boundary.This implies the amplitude at the boundary is 0.
As both the reflected wave and incident wave are completely out of phase at the boundary.Therefore φ=π.
Therefore, yi(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt),
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx + ωt + π) = – a sin (kx + ωt)
By superposition principle y= yi + yr =0
Conclusion: -
The reflection at the rigid body will take place with a phase reversal of π or 180.
Reflection at open boundary

The reflection at an open boundary will take place without any phase change.
In this case at boundary pulse is generated.Therefore amplitude at the boundary is maximum.
This means the reflected wave and incident wave are in phase with each other.As a result the phase difference φ=0.
Therefore, yi(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt),
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt).By superposition principle y= yi + yr =2a sin (kx – ωt)

"Standing (Stationary) Waves

A stationary wave is a wave which is not moving,i.e. it is at rest.
When two waves with the same frequency,wavelengthand amplitude travelling in opposite directions will interfere they produce a standing wave.
 



Conditions to have a standing wave:- Two travelling waves can produce a standing wave, if the waves are moving in opposite directions and they have the same amplitude and frequency.
At certain instances when the peaksof both the waves will overlap. Then both the peaks will add up to form the resultant wave.
At certain instances when the peak of the one wave combine with the negative of the second wave .Then the net amplitude will become 0.
As a result a standing wave is produced. In case of stationary wave the waveformdoes not move.
Explanation:-
Consider Ist wave in the figure and suppose we have a rigid wall which does not move. When anincident wave hits the rigid wall it reflects back with a phase difference of π.
Consider IInd wave in the figure, when the reflected wave travels towards the left there is another incident wave which is coming towards right.
The incident wave is continuously coming come from left to right and the reflected wave will keep continuing from right to left.
At some instant of time there will be two waves one going towards right and one going towards left as a result these two waves will overlap and form a standing wave.
Mathematically:
Wave travelling towards left yl(x,t) =a sin(kx– ωt) and towards right yr(x,t) =a sin (kx + ωt)
The principle of superposition gives, for the combined wave
y (x, t) = yl(x, t) + yr(x, t)= a sin (kx – ωt) + a sin (kx + ωt)
y(x,t)= (2a sin kx) cos ωt (By calculating and simplifying)
The above equation represents the standing wave expression.
Amplitude = 2a sin kx.
The amplitude is dependent on the position of the particle.
The cos ωt represents the time dependent variation or the phase of the standing wave.","Definition, Effects, Property, Formula, Relation"

=> sinkx = sin(n+(1/2)) =>π=>kx=(n+(1/2)) =>π=>((2 π)/ λ) x= (n+(1/2)) π
The position of nodes is represented by:- x= (n+(1/2))( λ/2) ; n=0,1,2,3,4 …
Note: -

Half awavelength separates two consecutive nodes.
Antinodes are located half way between pairs of nodes.

"Nodes and Antinodes: system closed at both ends

System closed at both ends means both the ends are rigid boundaries.
Whenever there is rigid body there is no displacement at the boundary. This implies at boundary amplitude is always 0. Nodes are formed at boundary.
Standing waves on a string of length L fixed at both ends have restricted wavelength.
This means wave will vibrate for certain specific values of wavelength.
At both ends,nodes will be formed.=>Amplitude=0.
Expression for node x =(nλ)/2.This value is true when x is 0 and L.
When x=L:- L=(nλ)/2 =>λ=(2L)/n ; n=1,2,3,4,…..
λ cannot take any value but it can take values which satisfy λ=(2L)/n this expression.
That is why we can say that the standing wave on a string which is tied on both ends has the restricted wavelength.
As wavelength is restricted therefore wavenumber is also restricted.
ν =v/λ (relation between wavelength and frequency)
Corresponding frequencies which a standing wave can have is given as: -ν= (vn)/2Lwhere v= speed of the travelling wave.
These frequencies are known as natural frequency or modes of oscillations.","Property, Formula, Relation, Definition, Reasoning"
"Modes of Oscillations:-

ν= (vn)/2L where v=speed of the travelling wave, L=length of the string,  n=any natural number.
First Harmonic:-
For n=1, mode of oscillation is known as Fundamental mode.
Therefore ν1=v/(2L).This is the lowest possible value of frequency.
Therefore ν1is the lowest possible mode of the frequency.
2 nodes at the ends and 1 antinode.
Second Harmonic:-
For n=2, ν2=(2v)/ (2L) =v/L
This is second harmonic mode of oscillation.
3 nodes at the ends and 2 antinodes.
ThirdHarmonic:-
For n=3,ν3 = (3v)/ (2L).
This is third harmonic mode of oscillation.
4 nodes and 3 antinodes.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Nodes and Antinodes: system closed at one end

For a system which is closed at one end,only one node is formed at the closed end.
Consider there is one fixed end(x=0) and one open end(x=L), and a string is attached between these two ends.
At x=L, antinodes will be formed.This means amplitude will be maximum at this end.
Condition for formation of antinodes is x= (n+ (1/2)) (λ/2).=>L=(n+ (1/2)) (λ/2)
=>λ=(2L)/(n+(1/2)).This expression shows that the values of wavelength is restricted. n=0, 1, 2, 3…
Corresponding frequencies will be ν= v/(2L)(n+1/2) (By using ν=v/λ);n=0,1,2,3, …","Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
"Modes of oscillations:-

Fundamental frequency:- Also known as First Harmonic:-It corresponds to lowest possible value for n. That is n=0.
The expression for fundamental frequency is ν0 = v/(2L)x1/2 = v/(4L)
Odd Harmonics
n=1 ; ν =v/(2L)(1+(1/2)) = (3v)/(4L) =3ν0
n=2; ν =v/(2L)(2+(1/2))= (5v)/(4L)=5ν0
n=3;ν =v/(2L)(3+(1/2))=(7v)/(4L)=7ν0
For a system which is closed at one end and open at another end will get one fundamental frequency and all other odd harmonics.","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Beats

Beats is the phenomenon caused by two sound waves of nearly same frequencies and amplitudes travelling in the same direction.

For example:-

Tuning of musical instruments like piano, harmonium etc. Before we start playing on these musical instruments they are set against the standard frequency. If it is not set a striking noise will keep on coming till it is set.
Mathematically

Consider only the time dependent and not the position dependent part of the wave.
s1=a cos ω1t and s2=a cos ω2t; where amplitude and phase of the waves are same,but the frequencies are varying. Also considering ω1> ω2.
When these 2 waves superimpose s= s1+ s2=a[cos ω1t + cos ω2t]
By simplifying , 2a (cos(ω1 - ω2)/2)t cos(ω1 + ω2)/2)t)
=>ω1 - ω2 is very small as ω1> ω2.Let (ω1 - ω2 )=ωb
=>ω1 + ω2 is very large. Let (ω1 + ω2 )=ωa
s= 2a cos ωbt cos ωat
cosωat will vary rapidly with time and 2acosωbt will change slowly with time.
Therefore we can say 2acosωbt = constant. As a result 2acosωbt = amplitude as it has small angular variation.","Definition, Examples, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
"Beat Frequency

Beat frequency can be defined as the difference in the frequencies of two waves.
Consider if there is a wave of frequency ω1 and another wave of frequency ω2.Then the beat frequency will be ω1- ω2.
It is denoted by ω
Also ω = 2πν
Therefore νbeat = ν1 – ν2","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation"
"Doppler’s Effect

Doppler Effect is the phenomenon of motion-related frequency change.
Consider if a truck is coming from very far off location as it approaches near our house, the sound increases and when it passes our house the sound will be maximum. And when it goes away from our house sound decreases.
This effect is known as Doppler Effect.
A person who is observing is known as Observer and object from where the sound wave is getting generated it is known as Source.
When the observer and source come nearer to each other as a result waves get compressed. Therefore wavelength decreases and frequency increases.
Case 1:- stationary observer and moving source
Let the source is located at a distance L from the observer.
At any time t1, the source is at position P1.
Time taken by the wave to reach observer =L/v where v=speed of the sound wave.
After some time source moves to position P0 in time T0.
Distance between P1 and P0 =vsTo where vs is the velocity of the source.
Let t2be the time taken by the second wave to reach the observer
Total time taken by the for the second wave to be sent to the observer = To +( L+vsTo)/v
Total time taken by the for the third wave to be sent to the observer=2To +( L+2vsTo)/v
Therefore for nth point tn+1 =nTo +( L+nvsTo)/v
=>In time tn+1the observer captures n waves.
Total time taken by the waves to travel Time period T= (tn+1 - t1)/n
=To +(vsTo)/v =>T=To(1+vs/v)
Or v= 1/T
=>v = v0(1+vs/v)-1
By using binomial Theorem,v= v0 (1- vs/v)
If the source is moving towards the observer the expression will become v= v0 (1+ vs/v)
Case 2:- moving observer and stationary source
As the source is not moving therefore vs is replaced by -v0.
Therefore v= v0 (1+ v0/v)","Definition, Property, Formula, Relation, Reasoning"
