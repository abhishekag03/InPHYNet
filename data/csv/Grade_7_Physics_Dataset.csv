Moving air is called Wind.,Definition
"Since air is a mixture of gases, wind is the flow of gases on a large scale.
Winds are caused by heating difference between different parts of the world and the movement of the earth.
Winds can be of classified on the basis of:
Duration: Long and Short
Strength: High, medium and low
Speed: Slow and Fast
High strength winds for longer duration, like cyclone or hurricanes, may cause hazardous effects.","Definition, Types, Property, Effects"
"Applications of wind include Windmills (to generate electricity), fan, flying kite, Hair Dryer etc.",Examples
Atmospheric pressureis the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere of Earth (or that of another planet).,Definition
"All gases in the atmosphere exert pressure on each other, the earth and the objects on earth including humans.
The pressure exerted on a human body by atmosphere is compensated by the pressure exerted by the gases inside human body.
The force or the pressure exerted by air/wind makes loose paper, hair, flags, leaves of trees
Manual tasks like riding bicycle or rowing boat against the wind requires more muscular energy, than normal, due to the opposing pressure exerted by wind.Similarly, If riding and rowing are being done in the direction of wind, then these tasks require less muscular energy than normal.","Effects, Reasoning, Examples"
"Distortion of tin can or bottle
Closed Tin can half filled with boiling water.
The can will have hot water as well as steam.
Now, pouring cold water will make the steam condense and become water.
This reduces air inside the can.
Since the pressure of air inside can becomes lower than air outside, the can’s shape will become distorted.","Reasoning, Causes"
"Sucking a straw decreases pressure inside it, this makes the outside atmospheric pressure become higher and the fluid thus goes up through the straw.
Tyre tube bursts when over filled with air due to the fact that the pressure inside the tube becomes higher than the outer atmospheric pressure","Effects, Reasoning"
"As the pressure of an area reduces, wind speed increases and vice versa. Higher the pressure difference, higher the speed of wind.","Reasoning, Property"
"Thus, the two major concepts are:

High speed winds are accompanied by reduced air pressure.
Air travels from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.",Property
"Air molecules expand on heating and contract on cooling.
Hot air molecules take more space than cold air molecules.
Warm or Hot air is lighter than cool air.
Warm air, like smoke, rises up and cool air settles down.
When warm air rises up, it creates low pressure in the area, so surrounding cooler air, from relatively higher pressure, then comes to take up its place.",Property
"When a test tube is immersed in hot water, the air inside it expands and tries to take more space. On the other hand, when immersed in cold water, the air inside the tube contracts a little and tries to take up lesser space than normal.",Reasoning
"Winds or wind currents are generated by two factors:

Uneven heating between Poles and Equator",Reasoning
"Centre of the earth is called Equator and the two extreme positions are Poles.
Poles are cooler than equator as highest intensity of the sun’s heat and light falls on the equator and it reduces as we go either side of equator towards the poles.
Cooler air from surrounding areas of the equator comes towards the equator to fill the place of warm air which rises up due to sun’s heating.
Similarly, cooler air from poles comes towards the surrounding areas as the surrounding areas have air warmer than the poles.
These winds from north to equator and south to equator are not straight as their direction change due to earth’s rotation on its axis.","Reasoning, Causes, Effects"
"Summer and Winter Winds
During summer season, winds blow from sea towards land on a large scale.
These winds carry water droplets with them and form clouds.
During monsoon season, these clouds rain as they become heavier.
Rain is useful for farmers for irrigation but excessive rain causes floods and diseases.
During winter season, the winds blow from land to sea and they do not carry any water droplets with them. Hence, Monsoon season occurs only after summer season.","Reasoning, Causes, Effects"
A storm is a disturbed state of environment creating severe weather conditions mainly high speed winds. A thunderstorm is a storm with sound and lightning and typically also heavy rain or hail.,Property
"Thunderstorms develop in hot and humid areas.
High temperature in this areas cause hot humid (with water vapours) air to rise up. So, strong upward rising winds with water droplets are generated.
At high altitude, these water drops freeze and fall again towards earth.
Upward movement of air and downward movement of water drops, together, cause lightning and sound.","Reasoning, Causes"
A Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around strong centers of low pressure,Definition
"Water vapors are formed when water is heated.
This heat is released to atmosphere when water vapors convert to water during rains.
The heat released, warms the air around and makes it to move up. This also results in decreased air pressure.
Hence, cooler air from surrounding rushes to take the warm air’s place.
This repeats till a low pressure system with surrounding high speed winds is created. This is called a Cyclone.
Cyclone depends on wind speed, direction, temperature and humidity.
Cyclones are also called Hurricane in USA and Typhoon in Japan and Philippines","Causes, Examples, Effects"
"East coastline of India (Mainly Orissa) is prone to Cyclones being a coastal area.
Cyclone hit areas result in loss of life, property, communication and transportation systems.
Cyclones cause a wall of water to move from sea towards shores resulting in destruction.
Cyclones also bring heavy rainfalls which could lead to flood situations.
Damages agricultural land and reduces soil fertility.",Effects
"A tornadois a violently rotating dark funnel shaped cloud that reached from sky towards ground.

Diameter of a tornado ranges from few meters to a km.
It grows bigger by taking dust and anything else near it. Smaller tornadoes can only make dust rotate with itself whereas a bigger tornado can take vehicles or even houses.
It sucks everything from bottom and throws them out from the top.
Tornadoes can attain a speed of 300km/hr.
They can form within cyclones.",Property
"An anemometer is a device used for measuring wind speed.

It consists of cup like structures to measure wind speed based on their movement.
It can also show the direction of the wind.",Property
"Safety Measures and Precautions
In case of a Cyclone or a Tornado, following are the safety measures to be taken on behalf of government and people:
Government should forecast cyclones 24 hours in advance with the help of satellites and radars.
Cyclone and Tornado shelters should be made for people living in cyclone prone areas. These are rooms made underground and away from shores having no windows.
Quick communication to government agencies, fishermen, ports to make necessary arrangements and minimize destruction.
As an individual, when cyclone or a tornado strikes, take shelter under tables, bow down and protect head and neck using arms.
Keep away from water in cyclone-hit areas as the water might be contaminated.
Stay inside houses.
Should not ignore warnings from meteorological department.
Should have all emergency numbers.
Avoid driving on roads full of water as the roads might be damaged or the vehicle may get stuck with water going inside the machinery.
Cyclone/Tornado can cause damage to electric poles and it may cause short circuit and electric shocks.
Cooperate and help others.",Reasoning

"We use devices like clocks to measure time. Clocks work on a simple concept of periodic motion. Simple pendulum is the most common object to exhibit periodic motion.
","Property, Examples"
"Simple pendulum
A simple pendulum consists of a small metallic ball (called a bob) suspended by a thread.
The pendulum has an oscillatory motion. The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period. The time period of the pendulum increases with an increase in the length of the string from which it is suspended.","Definition, Property"

"What is light?
Light is a radiation or a form of energy that our eyes can detect. Light enables us to view our surroundings. Light travels from one place to another in a straight line",Definition
"For instance, if you look at the flame of a candle with a straight pipe we can easily view the candle. However, if we bend the pipe we cannot view the candle and the light coming through it because it is blocked.","Example, Reasoning"
"Reflection of Light
Whenever light hits an object it is either absorbed or reflected back.",Definition

"The distance between the image and the mirror, and the object and the mirror always remain the same.",Property
"If we increase or decrease the distance between the object and the mirror, the distance between the image and the mirror also increases or decreases, respectively.",Property
"However, the size of the image formed on the mirror can vary with respect to the distance between the object and the mirror.",Property
"If the distance between the object and the mirror increases, the size of the image decreases and vice-versa.",Property
An image is said to be erect if the image is formed the same side up as that of the object.,Definition

"The image formed by the mirror is always left-right inverted. This means that the right side of the object appears as the left side of the image, and the left side of the object appears at the right side of the image.","Property, Reasoning"
"Why the word ‘AMBULANCE’ is painted on an ambulance left-right inverted?
This is because of the left-right inversion of the image on a mirror. The word ambulance written as left-right inverted would, therefore, be read easily by the driver of the vehicle ahead of the ambulance in its rearview mirror. The rear view mirror will again invert the word left-right wise.","Reasoning, Property"

"Heat
Heat is the transfer of energy from a hot body. The sense of touch can be used to understand the degree of hotness or coldness of something. But the sense of touch is not reliable and cannot be always used to say how much hot anything is. Moreover, using the sense of touch can be risky in case of something being very hot.

"Thermometer:
Thermometer is a device which is used to measure temperature. Thermometer is made of a long narrow glass tube; with a bulb at one end. The narrow tube appears as a continuous silver line; because it is filled with mercury. Mercury is a metal which is in liquid state at room temperature and it readily expands or contracts at the slightest change in temperature. Hence, mercury is used in thermometer.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
Laboratory Thermometer: Laboratory thermometer is used to measure the temperature. The scale of temperature is graduated generally from –10°C to 110°C over the glass tube. Each division of temperature scale is further divided into 10 parts to read fraction of temperature.,"Definition, Property"
Clinical Thermometer: Clinical thermometer is used to measure the body temperature. The scale of temperature is graduated from 35°C to 42°C and or from 94°F to 108°F. The temperature of human body always remains within this range and this is the range on the clinical thermometer. There is a kink near the bulb of clinical thermometer which prevents the automatic fall of mercury level.,"Definition, Property"
"Digital Thermometer: In digital thermometer, reading of temperature is displayed digitally as in digital watches. This is safer because no mercury is used in this. It is important to note that mercury is a highly toxic substance.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
Maximum-Minimum Thermometer: Maximum – minimum thermometer is used to measure the daily temperature to prepare weather reports.,"Definition, Property"
"Reading of thermometer and measuring of temperature:
Take a clinical thermometer and hold it horizontally with reading scale towards your eye.
Do not hold the thermometer from the bulb.
Rotate the thermometer slightly clockwise and anticlockwise. By doing this you will see a shiny thin silvery thread.
The end of the silvery thread shows the reading of temperature. If mercury lining ends at 37, the reading is 37°C.
Wash the bulb end of thermometer with an antiseptic solution.
Give two or three jerks slightly. By doing this the mercury level would fall. When it falls to 35°C or below, put it below the tongue and wait for one minute.
Take out the thermometer and read the temperature. Temperature would be near 37°C.
The normal body temperature is 37°C. This can differ from person to person",Reasoning
"Use of Laboratory Thermometer:
Take some water in a beaker.
Take a laboratory thermometer and immerse its bulb end in water; holding it vertically. Ensure to dip whole portion of bulb end. The bulb end should not touch the bottom or side of the beaker.
Observe the movement of rise of mercury. When it becomes stable, take the reading of the thermometer.
Repeat this with hot water and take the reading.",Reasoning
"Difference between clinical and laboratory thermometer:
Clinical Thermometer        Laboratory Thermometer
Clinical thermometer is scaled from 35°C to 42°C or from 94°F to 108°F.        Laboratory thermometer is generally scaled from -10°C to 110°C.
Mercury level does not fall on its own, as there is a kink near the bulb to prevent the fall of mercury level.        Mercury level falls on its own as no kink is present.
Temperature can be read after removing the thermometer from armpit or mouth.        Temperature is read while keeping the thermometer in the source of temperature, e.g. a liquid or any other thing.
To lower the mercury level jerks are given.        No need to give jerk to lower the mercury level.
It is used for taking the body temperature.        It is used to take temperature in laboratory.","Definition, Reasoning"
"Transfer of heat:
Heat is transferred by conduction, convection and radiation.

","Definition, Property"
"Conduction:
Transfer of heat from one particle to the adjacent particle is known as conduction of heat. In solids, heat is transferred by the process of conduction. In this process, the transfer of heat takes place through adjacent molecules","Definition, Property"
"Example: When one end of an iron rod is put over flame then part which is nearer to the flame is heated first and heat is gradually transferred to the other end of the rod. This happens because particles of iron rod which are nearer to the flame receive the heat and transfer this to the adjacent particles. Subsequently, the adjacent particles transfer the heat to the next adjacent particles. This process continues and heat reaches to the other end of the rod. Thus, heat transfer in solid takes place through conduction.","Examples, Causes"
"Materials which allow heat to pass through it are called conductor or good conductor of heat, such as iron, copper, aluminium, etc. All metals are good conductors of heat. Since, mercury is a metal and found in liquid state at room temperature, that’s why it is used in thermometer
Since metals are the good conductor of heat that’s why kitchen utensils are made of metals or alloys of metals.","Definition, Reasoning, Effects"
"Materials which do not allow heat to pass through them are called bad conductor or poor conductor of heat. They are also called insulators. Example: rubber, wood, plastic, etc. This is the cause that handles of frying pan or other kitchen utensils are made of plastic.","Definition, Examples, Causes"
"Convection:
The transfer of heat because of movement of the molecules of the medium; via mass transfer; is called convection or convection of heat.

",Definition
"Water and air are bad conductors of heat. But they do become hot, in spite of being bad conductors. Heat transfer in fluids takes place through convection","Definition, Property"
"Convection in water: When water is heated in a pan, the particles of water which are near the source of heat; get heated first. Because of heating, they become light; and rise in water. The gap which is created because of rise of hot particles is filled by cold particles of water from the surrounding area. Thus a cyclical movement of particles begins and ends up heating the whole water of the pan. The cyclical movement in fluids because of heating is called convection current.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Causes"
Convection in air: Air gets heated because of convection; the way water gets heated. Air near the source of heat gets heated and rises above. This leaves a gap; which is filled by the colder air from the surrounding. The convection current thus starts in air which results in heating up of air.,"Definition, Reasoning, Causes"
When you place your palm above a flame you will feel the hotness of the flame. But when you will place your palm below the flame the area will be colder. This shows how the colder air from below moves up; due to convection current.,Reasoning
"Sea Breeze: In coastal areas, the breeze that moves from sea surface to the land is called sea breeze. This happens because, during daytime, land gets heated more quickly than water. As a result, warm air from land rises up; leaving a gap. To fill that gap, colder air from the ocean surface rushes towards the land. This phenomenon continues and a continuous flow of cold air keeps coming towards the land. This gives rise to the phenomenon which is called the sea breeze. Because of this, people living in coastal areas prefer to live in a sea facing house.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Effects"
"Land Breeze: In coastal areas, the breeze which moves from land towards the sea is called land breeze. In the night, the land cools down more quickly than the ocean surface. This makes the air over the water surface warmer than air over the land surface. Warmer air over the water surface rises in the air and air from the land rushes towards the water surface to fill the gap. This phenomenon continues which creates a flow of air from land to the sea. This phenomenon is called land breeze.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Effects"
"Radiation:
All hot bodies emit heat by the process of radiation. Radiation of heat does not require a medium. Sunlight comes to the earth because of radiation as there is no medium present between the atmosphere of the earth and the sun.

One can feel the heat of bonfire by standing around it. We get warmth from the room heater because of radiation.","Definition, Property, Reasoning, Causes"
Reflection and absorption of heat: When heat falls over an object some of the heat is absorbed by the body and some of the heat is reflected. The temperature of an object increases because of absorption of heat.,"Property, Reasoning"
In conventional room heater you can see the reflector attached with it. The reflector of the room heater reflects the heat towards the person sitting or standing near the room heater.,Property
"Reflection is the cause that umbrella is used to protect from heat of the sun in summer. Dark color absorbs more heat while light color reflects most of the heat. That’s why wearing light colored clothes is preferred in summer, dark colored clothes are preferred in winter.","Causes, Reasoning"
"Dark clothes absorb more heat and keep one comfortable in winter. On the other hand, light clothes reflect most of the heat and keep one comfortable in summer.

Now-a-days many kitchen utensils come in black color, since utensils of black color absorb more heat and thus cooking becomes faster.","Property, Reasoning, Causes"
"Woolen Cloth: Woolen clothes are used in winter season. Wool is a poor conductor of heat. In addition to it; air gets trapped in woolen fiber to further increase the poor conductivity of wool. This prevents the radiation of heat of our body to the surrounding and prevents the cold from surrounding to affect our body. Thus, wearing woolen cloth makes one comfortable in winter season.","Property, Reasoning"
"Introduction

It is from our day to day observation that in winter we feel cold whereas in summer we feel hot. People avoid getting out of their houses during the scorching summer due to excessive heat outside. When you boil water it becomes hot and is hard to dip finger in it but as soon as you blow off the flame and keep it aside for some time it gets easy to dip your finger.",Reasoning
"During fever our body gets hot but as soon as we take medicine the body becomes cool.

",Reasoning
"Ice melts when kept outside but remains in cold solid form as long as kept inside the deep freezer. Have you ever wondered what changes or phenomenon makes this happen.

It is all due to temperature.","Reasoning, Causes"
"Temperature

A measure of hotness or coldness of an object that can be relied upon is known as temperature.",Definition
"It can be measured using three different units namely-

Degree Celsius: It is denoted as °C and read as degree Celsius or Celsius. For instance, 20°C will be read as twenty degree Celsius.
Fahrenheit: It is denoted as °F and read as degree Fahrenheit. For instance, 25°F will be read as twenty five degree Fahrenheit.
Kelvin: It is denoted as K. For instance, 100K will be read as hundred Kelvin.",Definition
Temperature can be sensed by touching but we cannot rely upon it. Therefore a device called thermometer is used to get the exact value of temperature.,Reasoning
"Thermometer

Thermometer is a device used to measure temperature of a body. It can be used to measure the temperature of the body during fever. It can also be used to measure the atmospheric temperature and temperature during chemical reactions. It consists of a long narrow glass tube appearing as a continuous silver line because it is filled with mercury readily expands or contracts at the slightest change in temperature and a bulb at one end.","Definition, Property"

"Laboratory thermometer

Laboratory thermometer is used to measure the temperature of things other than human body.",Definition
"Maximum minimum thermometer

The daily maximum and minimum temperatures reported in weather reports, are all measured by a thermometer known as the Maximum minimum thermometer.",Definition
"Clinical Thermometer

The thermometer used by us or doctors to measure the body temperature when we have fever is a clinical thermometer.
The scale used to measure the temperature is known as Celsius scale denoted by °C or Fahrenheit denoted by °F.
It reads temperature from 35°C to 42°C or from 94°F to 108°F.
It consists of a long, slender and uniform glass tube with a bulb at one end containing mercury.
There is a small shining thread of mercury outside the bulb.
There is a kink near the bulb which prevents mercury level from falling on its own.","Definition, Property"
While using the clinical thermometer to measure the human body temperature some measures must be followed to ensure proper reading of temperature,Reasoning
"The measures are as follows:

Wash the thermometer properly with an antiseptic solution.
Hold it definitely and give a few jerks which will bring the level of mercury down below 35°C.
Place the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue.
Wait for one minute, take the thermometer out and note the reading keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.
This reading gives the exact body temperature.
It is necessary to state the temperature with its unit denoted by °C.
It should be handled with care as on hitting against some hard object it can break.",Reasoning
"Human body temperature

The normal temperature of human body is 37°C which may differ from person to person. It may be either slightly higher or slightly lower.
This value is derived from the average body temperature of a large number of hale and hearty persons.
The temperature of human body normally does not go below 35oC or above 42o If the body temperature goes beyond the defined value then it is necessary to consult a doctor.
That is the reason that clinical thermometer has scale ranging from 35oC to 42o","Definition, Property"
"Laboratory thermometer

Clinical thermometer can never be used for measuring the temperature of any object other than human body.
It is used to measure the temperatures in school or other laboratories for scientific purpose as they measure temperatures to a range higher than clinical thermometers.
One such thermometer is known as the laboratory thermometer with a scale generally ranging from –10°C to 110°C. It has a long stem with a silver bulb at the end unlike clinical thermometer.
The silver colour at the bulb normally points toward the presence of mercury which expands with the rise in temperature thereby raising the reading and contracts on lowering of temperature thereby lowering the reading.","Definition, Property"
"Precautions to be observed while reading a Laboratory thermometer

Precautions involved while observing the readings of laboratory thermometer are similar to those followed while measuring temperature using a clinical thermometer. But in addition to few other steps must be followed.

Should be kept vertical without tilting.
The thermometer should be dipped in such a manner that the bulb should be entirely surrounded by the substance of which the temperature is to be measured.
At the same time bulb should not touch the surface of the container.",Reasoning
"It is common phenomenon and you all must have observed that when one end of utensil is heated, soon the other end also becomes hot
You also must have observed that while boiling water we heat the utensil only at bottom but the water at the top also becomes hot. Have you ever wondered why does this happen??
Another phenomenon that may make you wonder is the transmission of heat from the sun to the earth. It is a well-known fact that sun is far away from earth but still how can the heat travel such a huge distance and reach us
These are all due to some phenomenon that transfers the heat from one end to the other. Heat always transfers from the hotter end to the colder end. There are three modes through which the heat transfers from one end to the other, namely conduction, convection and radiation.","Reasoning, Types"
"Conduction

The process of transferring of heat from the hotter end to the colder end of an object is known as conduction. Whenever a utensil is kept on flame it becomes hot and the heat travels from the base of the utensil to its handle. This is due to the transfer of heat from the hotter base of the utensil to cold handle. When this pan is removed from the flame and kept aside soon the utensil cools down. This is again due to transfer of heat form the hot utensil to cold surrounding.","Definition, Property, Causes"
"Generally, the heat is transferred in solids by the process of conduction. It is the most important mode of heat transfer in solids than in liquids and gases.
But it is not necessary that all solids will conduct heat because there are many solids that are poor conductors of heat.
Materials that allow heat to pass through them easily are known as conductors of heat. For instance, all metals like aluminium, iron and copper are conductors of heat.
Whereas those materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are known as poor conductors of heat. For instance, plastic, wood, water and air. They are also termed as insulators.","Property, Definition, Examples"
Therefore the concept of conduction is applicable to solids and that to only those solids which are good conductors of heat.,Property
"Here temperature at side A is TA and the temperature at side B is TB.

There is a temperature difference as TA > TB.
So in this heat transfer will take place from A to B because we already learnt that heat transfers from the higher temperature to lower temperature.
Heat From side A starts losing heat and side B will gain heat.
So temperature at side A will decrease and that on side B will increase because it is gaining heat. But after sometime time the temperature will become equal on both the sides.
This situation is called steady state and after this no transfer of heat will take place because conduction comes into act only if there is a temperature difference.","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"Convection

The method of transferring heat by the movement of the particles of substance away from the source of heat is known as convection. It takes place only in liquids and gases.","Definition, Property"
"On heating the water, the part of it near the flame gets heated up and expands due to which it becomes less dense and consequently rises up.
This creates a vacuum and the cold water from the sides slides down to occupy the space near the flame.
This water also gets heated up and rises.
Again the cold water slides down. So it is like a cycle that continues again and again until and unless the entire water is heated up.
This process continues unless the whole water present in the beaker gets heated up.
The air too gets heated up by this process. The air near the heat source gets heated up and rises. The cold air from the sides slides to occupy the space. In this way the air gets heated.
Due to this reason the air just above the flame of candle is hotter than the air at the side.
","Property, Reasoning"
"Sea Breeze and Land Breeze

The land gets heated up by the heat radiated by the sun, much faster than the water during daytime. This heats up the air over the land and it expands and hence the hot air rises up and creates a vacuum. The cool air from the sea occupies the space left by the hot air. The warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle. The air from the sea is called the sea breeze.
But the reverse process takes place at night. The land cools down quickly and sea water remains hot. This heats up the air over the sea and it expands and hence the hot air rises up and creates a vacuum. The cool air from the land occupies the space left by the hot air. And hence the cool air moves from the land to the sea and is known as the land breeze.

","Definition, Property, Reasoning"
"Radiation

The heat given off from the sun cannot reach us by the process of conduction or convection because both the processes requires a medium to transfer the heat but due to absence of a medium such as air in maximum layers of space between the earth and the sun these processes cannot transfer the heat to the earth.
At this moment another process called radiation comes into act to transfer the heat radiated by the sun to the earth.
This heat transferring process doesn’t require any medium.
These are the form of electromagnetic waves. Their characteristic is that they can travel through vacuum and travel with speed of light (3X108 m/s). This propagation of heat from sun to earth involves both electric field represented by E and magnetic field represented by B.","Reasoning, Definition, Property"
"Not only sun but all hot bodies radiate heat. That can propagate through medium or even in vacuum. Heating of room by a room heater, heating up of utensils kept over flame and then cooling down when kept away from heat are all due to radiation.","Reasoning, Effects"
Human body releases heat to the surroundings and receives heat from it by the process of radiation. This can be proved using a simple example. You feel quite comfortable in a room with one person but if the same room has many people you feel hot due to the radiation of heat from the human body.,"Reasoning, Effects"
" All hot bodies radiate heat which falls on the nearby objects.
",Property
"The objects absorb some part of heat, reflect some part of heat and transmit some part of the heat falling on them. The temperature of the object increases due to the absorbed part of the heat.
",Property
"Light colours are the best reflectors of heat falling and as a result light coloured clothes reflect maximum amount of heat they receive and makes us feel cool to some extent and hence we feel more comfortable wearing them in the summer.

","Property, Reasoning"
"But on the other hand dark colours are good absorbers of heat falling on them and as a result the dark coloured clothes absorb maximum amount of heat they receive and makes us feel warm and comfortable during winter.

","Property, Reasoning"
"Winters seasons are also accompanied with woollen clothes. This is due to the reason that wool being a poor conductor of heat traps the air in between the woollen fibres. The trapped air prevents the flow of heat from our body to the cold surroundings and vice versa thereby making us feel warm.

"Working of an Electric Bell
When the switch of the Bell is ON, an electric current flows through the coil of wire which makes the iron piece attached to it act as an Electromagnet.

As a result, the iron piece attracts the hammer towards itself. The hammer thus hits the bell and a sound is produced.

As the hammer move towards the iron piece, it moves away from the contact screw which breaks down the circuit.

As the circuit breaks the wire coil stops receiving any current which makes the electromagnet lose its magnetic effect.

As a result, the hammer falls back to its original position.

Then as the hammer falls back the iron strip again comes in contact with the contact screw and the circuit gets completed.

This again turns the iron piece into an electromagnet and the whole process continues until the bell is switched OFF. This results in the continuous ringing of the bell."," Reasoning, Property"
